# 主编的话

上世纪80年代,为了全面地、系统地反映当代经济学的全貌及其进程,总结与挖掘当代经济学已有的和潜在的成果,展示当代经济学新的发展方向,我们决定出版“当代经济学系列丛书”。

“当代经济学系列丛书”是大型的、高层次的、综合性的经济学术理论丛书。它包括三个子系列:(1)当代经济学文库;(2)当代经济学译库;(3)当代经济学教学参考书系。本丛书在学科领域方面,不仅着眼于各传统经济学科的新成果,更注重经济学前沿学科、边缘学科和综合学科的新成就;在选题的采择上,广泛联系海内外学者,努力开掘学术功力深厚、思想新颖独到、作品水平拔尖的著作。“文库”力求达到中国经济学界当前的最高水平;“译库”翻译当代经济学的名人名著;“教学参考书系”主要出版国内外著名高等院校最新的经济学通用教材。

20多年过去了,本丛书先后出版了200多种著作,在很大程度上推动了中国经济学的现代化和国际标准化。这主要体现在两个方面:一是从研究范围、研究内容、研究方法、分析技术等方面完成了中国经济学从传统向现代的转轨;二是培养了整整一代青年经济学人,如今他们大都成长为中国第一线的经济学家,活跃在国内外的学术舞台上。

为了进一步推动中国经济学的发展,我们将继续引进翻译出版国际上经济学的最新研究成果,加强中国经济学家与世界各国经济学家之间的交流;同时,我们更鼓励中国经济学家创建自己的理论体系,在自主的理论框架内消化和吸收世界上最优秀的理论成果,并把它放到中国经济改革发展的实践中进行筛选和检验,进而寻找属于中国的又面向未来世界的经济制度和经济理论,使中国经济学真正立足于世界经济学之林。

我们渴望经济学家支持我们的追求;我们和经济学家一起瞻望中国经济学的未来。

# 第二版前言

承蒙读者厚爱,书几年前即已售完。出版社希望将此书收录入“当代经济学系列丛书”,问我是否愿意趁机做些修订,我欣然允诺。然而,我很快发现时间远比想象的要少,修订工作时断时续,前后花费近三年才终于完成。

说起来是修订,其实是重写。除了原来的基本观点、分析架构大体不变之外,书的绝大多数章节都有较大幅度的修改和补充。自从2008年第一版问世以来,围绕着中国官员激励和政府治理这条主线我自己做了许多后续的研究,国内外学术界也涌现了一系列新的研究成果,在修订过程中我尽可能将最新的研究进展吸收进来。

就我自己而言,首先是沿着政治锦标赛的研究思路进行了一系列的拓展式研究,比如“层层加码”现象分析,地区间投资的空间效应,官员动态锦标赛,省交界地带的贫困问题,官员特征对地区投资、银行信贷的影响,政治商业周期、政治预算周期,“大跃进”时期与改革开放时期两个政治锦标赛的比较。在政治锦标赛的概念基础上我又进一步提出了“官场+市场”的分析视角,探讨了官场竞争与市场竞争之间的映射关系和互动模式。我认为,过去30年“官场+市场”的双层竞争模式驱动了中国经济的高速增长,塑造了中国独具特色的政经结构、市场经济和政商关系。基于这个视角,我区分了制度化的政企关系(比如地方政府与国有企业之间)与极具人格化的官商关系(如地方官员与民营企业家之间)的不同性质,以此为线索考察了过去30年从政企关系到官商关系的演变过程。我也把中国政府与市场的关系特征与东亚模式(如“日本股份公司”)、“发展型国家”等概念类型进行了对比,提出了“竞争性地方股份公司”的概括。

修订过程中改动最多的部分是行政发包制理论。在书的第一版提出这个概念的时候,我自信还是抓住了一些契合中国政府间关系的有趣而独特的现象,但是在分析层面上,不得不说它还是一个比较粗糙和模糊的知识想象。经过多年的反刍和推敲,特别是2012年以来我相继完成了几篇关于行政发包制的研究论文,行政发包制作为一种理想类型和分析理论终于有所突破和进步。从这个理论出发,我们可以更清晰地定义中国传统行政治理的特征,从而更准确地观察和识别过去20年来中国政府治理所经历的各项变革及其协同性、系统性和驱动力。我还尝试对条块关系和时下流行的项目制做了一些解析。不仅如此,行政发包制与政治锦标赛还更加有机地结合在一起,用于揭示中国国家治理能力的强项与弱项,地方政府内部的“帮助之手”与“掠夺之手”以及定义政府内部发包的组织边界。

关于中国官员激励与政府治理的特征和机制,学术界并不缺乏观察和相关研究,缺乏的是一种相对简洁、统一的理论,以便组织、梳理各式各样的观察现象并揭示其背后的相关性和一致性。这些年来,我一直在追寻这样的理论,本书就是对这个探索历程的忠实记录,希望可以为学术界起到抛砖引玉的作用。

感谢格致出版社的钱敏编辑,她的耐心细致和专业精神令人印象深刻。我的相关研究得到了国家自然科学基金面上项目的资助(项目批准号70973004),本书的修订也得到了我的学生吴敏、曹光宇的热情协助,一并致谢。

最后还是要感谢我的家人。本书从最初问世到修订见证了女儿文文的成长,也夺去了许多应该陪伴她的时光,对于后者我深感愧疚。我这些年专注于研究与工作,如果没有妻子和女儿的理解和支持是难以想象的,在此特别感谢她们。

# 前言

回顾中国过去的30年,中国经济的迅速崛起几乎超出了所有人的预期。对于一个30年前还是商品高度匮乏、人民生活水平低下、国民经济到了崩溃边缘的人口大国,30年后国内生产总值(GDP)已经名列世界第四,平均年增长率接近10%,而这一切又发生在一个发展中的社会主义国家。这个事实首先令西方学者和观察家感到困惑。西方人的这种困惑在20世纪70年代曾经出现过,那一次是日本经济的崛起。西方人短时间内无法接受一个非西方国家能够在经济上与西方世界最发达的国家平起平坐,之后经过相当一段时间才终于在心理上接纳了这位东亚的新成员。这一次中国之崛起在思想和价值方面所带来的冲击波,我相信,远比日本崛起来得大,因为中国不仅是一个非西方国家,而且还是一个在政治和经济体制上与西方国家有着重大区别的国家。

平心而论,中国经济的奇迹对于中国人来说同样难以置信。如果说西方人的困惑在于他们不了解中国,而中国人的困惑则在于我们太了解中国。我们太熟悉中国政治和经济体制当中的各种弊端,我们太熟悉中国技术的落后,我们太熟悉中国人均资源的匮乏。打一个夸张一点的比喻,中国经济就如同一辆在高速公路上飞速奔跑的旧车,西方人作为局外人不理解为什么这么旧的车还能够一路高速行驶,认为里面一定有神秘装置;而坐在车内的中国人,发现满车的装置简陋不堪,心里也禁不住老犯嘀咕:这么旧的车为什么还能够一路狂奔?

这种普遍的困惑说明,关于大国崛起的起因,关于经济增长的条件和机制,关于中国经济的奇迹,我们知道的还是太少。我们需要重新审视中国的过去,重新认识和估价中国经济、政治和其他制度所包含的独特因素,正是这些因素使得中国经济在相对短暂的时期内迅速起飞。

本书就是理解中国行政体制中所包含的独特因素的一种尝试,它记录了我个人关于中国地方官员的激励与政府治理问题的一些观察和思考。我试图把中国经济的高速增长及其长期积累的各种问题与中国地方官员的激励和政府治理的独特制度联系起来。在整本书里,我想强调的是,中国当今地方官员的激励和治理模式的一些重要特征一直蕴涵在两千多年以来中国传统的官僚体制之中。无论是毛泽东还是邓小平,他们的施政理念都是最大限度地激活和发展这些特征,以推动中国的经济发展,然而结局却大不相同。近年来中国所发生的一系列变化又使得中国地方政府治理模式面临前所未有的挑战,并且正在经历着艰难而重要的转型。我们需要在一个系统的理论框架下去理解中国政府治理的过去和正在发生的变化。在中国改革开放30年之际,国内许多学者都在对中国这30年所走过的历程进行反思和总结。本书就算是我个人的一个反思和总结吧。

我在读博士期间开始对中国地方官员的激励和行为感兴趣。回国以后便有心写一本关于地方官员的书。这些年来,平时不仅跟踪和研读相关文献,每日浏览新闻和闲书时也格外关注与地方政府有关的内容。本书一部分内容来自过去的积累和近年来发表的一些相关的学术论文,但更多的内容是最近一年来的研究成果。

说起来只是一本小书问世,在整理自己所欠付的学术“债务”时发现,需要鸣谢的师长友人可以拉出一个长长的名单。虽然无法一一列举,但首先需要特别感谢的是我在斯坦福大学的导师青木昌彦教授。青木教授不仅在博士论文写作期间给予我无数细心的指点、评论和建议,毕业以后也一直鼓励我继续从事地方官员激励的研究,每次见面都会问及研究进展,并提出富有建设性的意见和建议。我从另外两位导师B.Douglas Bernheim和Antonio Rangel身上受益同样巨大,他们严谨、犀利和深邃的思想给我留下深刻印象。在斯坦福大学经济系求学期间有幸得到钱颖一教授耳提面命的教诲,亲眼目睹和见证了他的诸多经典论文的生产过程。我对中国地方官员问题的浓厚兴趣在很大程度上就来自于他的开创性工作和平时无数次的讨论和交流。钱老师对我的学术影响之深在本书可以得到很好的印证。

我想借此机会感谢我的合作者李宏彬和陈烨,我们在一起合作完成的论文成为本书的一个重要基础。在本书完稿之前曾有机会向香港中文大学的车嘉华讨教,受益匪浅。实际上在过去十年间我们围绕着本书的主题就曾有过数次深入交流,令我收获很大。

本书关于“行政逐级发包制”和“政治锦标赛模式”的部分内容2007年8月至11月间分别在天则经济研究所、复旦大学社会主义市场经济研究中心、浙江大学民营经济研究中心宣讲过,对于张曙光教授、张军教授和史晋川教授的盛情邀请以及与会者许多富有启发性的评论和建议,在此一并致谢。

在过去六年的时间里,我所在的工作单位——北京大学光华管理学院提供了良好的学术环境和氛围,尤其是应用经济系的同事和学生给了我很多的支持和鼓励。如果没有这样一个可以安心做学问的环境和同事之间频繁的思想交流,很难想象我会有信心从事本书的研究。我想特别感谢张维迎、蔡洪滨、陈玉宇这些年来对我研究工作的鼎力支持、合作和鼓励。另外,我的一些学生为本书的研究和写作提供了各式各样的热情协助,从数据收集到材料的准备,特别值得提及的是陈永伟、杨殊威、陶靖和余婧文同学的辛勤投入。

我也要特别感谢上海世纪出版集团社长陈昕先生和复旦大学新政治经济学研究中心的史正富教授,他们联袂主编“中国改革30年研究丛书”,使我有机会参与这个意义非凡的课题研究项目。今年四月份在北京召开了丛书中期报告会,陈平、肖耿、陈昕、史正富等诸位教授、专家对本书的初稿提出了中肯和令人鼓舞的评论和建议。格致出版社的钱敏女士为本书做了出色的编辑工作,认真仔细地核对文献,校正文字,使本书避免了许多不该有的错误。

近三年来,我在地方官员的激励和行为方面的研究得到了国家自然科学基金面上项目的资助(项目批准号70573008),本书也是该项研究的一个阶段性成果,特此感谢。

最后应该感谢我的家庭。因为忙于写书和其他的教学研究工作,无暇照顾家庭,两年来妻子带着幼小的女儿文文一直远在哈尔滨,我岳父、岳母为照顾文文倾注了大量的心血,他们默默的牺牲和奉献令我感激不尽。我猜想,两岁的女儿最不能理解的也许就是爸爸总是出现一段时间就神秘地不见了,希望以后能够向她解释明白。

# ABSTRACT

Starting from a poor, planning, nearly bankrupt economy in the late 1970s, China has emerged as a world economic superpower over the past three decades. China's economic miracle has profoundly challenged the conventional wisdom that property rights protection, an independent legal system, and a democratic government with checks and balances are requisite to support long-term growth. By international standards, China has a low ranking in the supply of all these institutional fundamentals. However, the sustainability of China's high economic growth has been threatened by a host of attendant problems and challenges, including environmental pollution, alarming income inequality and regional disparity, under-funded social security, and bureaucratic corruption. This book analyzes the institutional sources of China's high and sustained economic growth, as well as its downsides, using a unified conceptual framework focused on the incentives of local officials and government governance.

As an introduction to the entire book, Chapter 1 links the puzzle of China's growth miracle with the critical and positive role played by China's local governments. It elaborates on the special status of local governments in the Chinese political system and their unique contributions to China's economic reforms and development. In line with the literature's clarion call for“getting incentives right”in addition to“getting prices right”, Chapter 1 highlights the importance of“getting government incentives right”in understanding China's miraculous catch-up over the past three decades.

Our analysis of Chinese local governments is based upon two important theoretical concepts. One is administrative subcontracting , which will be addressed in Chapter 2, and the other is political tournament , which will be discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 2 demonstrates the value and significance of administrative subcontracting in characterizing China's intergovernmental relations and their evolution from ancient times. Instead of adopting a Weberian bureaucracy, Chinese intergovernmental relations have long followed a top-down subcontracting practice: the central government subcontracts virtually all administrative functions and public services to the intermediate subordinate government, and the latter further subcontracts all of these functions and services down to the next level of government, all the way down to the bottom-level local governments, such as counties or townships. By so doing, the central government specializes in major decision-making and monitoring and saves itself from routine micromanagement, and the middle-level local governments are mainly monitors of the lower-level governments. The lowest-level governments(counties and townships) are responsible for providing all essential public goods, no matter whether they are national or local in nature. In stark contrast with Weberian bureaucracy, administrative subcontracting features the de facto power of subcontractors(i.e. lower-level governments), fiscal or budget subcontracting with significant self-finance, and outcome-oriented evaluations. Chapter 2 examines in detail how the practices of“ sequential administrative subcontracting ”and“ territory management ”were established and developed in ancient times and later evolved in the era of the People's Republic of China, ranging from the planned economy regime to the post-reform regime. Some fundamental shifts in the traditional system occurred until the late 1990s in order to correct serious problems created by administrative subcontracting. We also discuss some determinants of the scope and extent of administrative subcontracting, highlighting the important role of monitoring costs, fiscal constraints, and governance risks. Finally we strive to establish administrative subcontracting as an ideal type differentiated from administrative decentralization, M-form organization, and government outsourcing.

Chapter 3 provides a historical overview of the successive waves of decentralization since 1958 and in particular the devolution of central authority since the beginning of economic reforms. This chapter seeks to describe and analyze the evolution of sequential administrative subcontracting and territorial management over the history of the People's Republic of China. Even during the planned economy regime, China maintained a much more decentralized economy than the Soviet model. Moreover, local governments played very important roles in economic planning and materials distribution, thanks to conscious and persistent efforts by Mao Zedong to weaken the control of the central ministries and empower local leaders. Since the advent of economic reforms in the late 1970s, China's decentralization has gone much further but featured a gradualist approach that started with freeing coastal areas from central control. Chapter 3 explores in detail the reasons why both Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping favored regional decentralization even though their economic regimes were so different, and why these reforms fared so differently in terms of their economic performances. It also elaborates on some recent developments in central-local relations and their implications, such as the vertical centralization of banking, taxation, and customs at the central level and of product quality regulation, land management, and other issues at the provincial level.

Chapter 4 focuses on the evolution of central-local fiscal sharing since 1949 and its underlying logic. In contrast to the common perception, China's central-local fiscal relations in the pre-reform period displayed a significant degree of fiscal decentralization and subcontracting. Fiscal subcontracting refers to a fiscal sharing relation whereby a higher-level government certifies and fixes the expenditure obligations of lower-level governments, and if these lower-level governments can generate more revenues than the certified budgetary expenditures, then they can keep the remainder or a large proportion of it. The popularity of fiscal subcontracting between governments at different levels in a centralized planning regime can be understood by the necessity to support top-down administrative subcontracting arrangements, and to incentivize local governments to generate revenue and minimize expenditures. The fiscal contracting reforms started in the early 1980s represented an important extension of previous fiscal subcontracting relations in the planning regime. Under the new fiscal contracting system, local governments essentially became residual claimants of locally-generated revenues, and they gained increased autonomy over budgetary expenditures. While tax-sharing reforms initiated in 1994 substantially increased the center's fiscal authority, China's intergovernmental fiscal relations still maintained some basic features of traditional fiscal sharing, especially at subnational levels. Chapter 4 also discusses the role of extra-budgetary funds in China's local public finance as well as the current situation of intergovernmental fiscal relations at subnational levels.

Chapter 5 outlines an important governance mechanism deeply rooted in China's traditional political system—“political tournaments”, that is, competition among same-ranked local leaders in different regions for promotion to a position of higher rank. China's miraculous economic take-off occurred when promotion tournaments shifted their focus from political loyalty-based competition during the Mao era to economic-performance-based competition during the Deng era. Chapter 5 lists several preconditions which make China particularly suitable for applying growth performance-based promotion tournaments as an incentive scheme, such as: the centralized personnel control system, the lock-in effect in local officials careers, the M-form organization of the economy, and the multiple layers of territorial administration. It discusses the transition in political tournaments from the Mao regime to the Deng regime in detail. The performance-based promotion tournaments provide a vital ingredient for China's growth miracle. We also discuss the limitations of political tournaments as an incentive system when promotion becomes very difficult for most bureaucrats, especially at the lower levels of the administrative hierarchy. The last section explores the implications of a tale of dual markets created by performance-based tournaments, namely the interaction and bundling between political markets for local leaders and commercial markets for firms. Given promotion tournaments, market competition among firms located in various jurisdictions affects the economic performance of local leaders, while political competition among local leaders affects their efforts to support local firms in their jurisdictions to win in market competition.

Chapters 6—8 extend the analysis of the“dual markets model”proposed in Chapter 5 to reveal the political economy logic of China's economic growth model. Chapter 6 looks at the interaction between politics and markets, Chinese style. We document the interesting phenomenon of“top-down acceleration of growth targets”appearing in China's five-year plans at both central and local levels over the past three decades. We then link this phenomenon to the simultaneous promotion tournaments at different hierarchical levels. Chapter 6 also analyzes several other interesting issues. First, it examines the incentives of local leaders in a dynamic tournament setting, where an interim ranking of GDP growth across rival regions affects the incentive of local leaders to promote the current year's GDP growth. Second, we present evidence on the presence of a political business cycle in China and find statistically significant correlations between local leaders' age and investment growth, and between local Party congresses and resource misallocation in manufacturing. Finally, we find that city leaders' age significantly affects bank lending growth and performance; the peak of this effect appears between the ages of 54 and 55 when city leaders are close to the termination of their authority.

Chapter 7 analyzes the impact of local officials' promotion incentives on interregional competition and cooperation. There is a great deal of evidence pointing to the prolonged presence of local protectionism, duplicative investments in infrastructure and key manufacturing industries, and excessive competition in attracting FDI and many other areas. The mainstream interpretation of these phenomena in interregional interactions emphasizes the fiscal incentives of local governments to protect or expand local tax bases. However, this explanation fails to capture the essence of these phenomena: why are local leaders unable to sit down and reach an agreement to gain more from trade and cooperation? The failure of political cooperation among local leaders can be better understood by their promotion incentives: there is little benefit from cooperation but much to potentially gain through competition in a zero-sum promotion game. Moreover, the tremendous difficulty of compensating losers in the political arena makes ex ante cooperative agreement virtually impossible. Chapter 7 applies this perspective to explain why so much poverty and cross-border pollution occur among the border regions in China. The massive poverty in the border regions is not a geographical phenomenon, but a result of coordination failure among local leaders in the border regions. Local leaders who are in competition for promotion fear that if their part of the border region is developed, then there will be positive spillovers to the neighboring regions whose leaders are their political rivals. This analysis provides a political economy interpretation of China's widening regional disparity over the past several decades.

Chapter 8 examines the evolution of the local government-business relationship over time. It first describes the evolving nature of the relationship between local governments and state-owned enterprises(SOEs), explaining how the subcontracting relationship between local governments and SOEs affected the path and outcomes of SOE reforms. Then it turns to explore the role of local governments in the rise and fall of township and village enterprises(TVEs). The positive role of township and village leaders in the rise of TVEs offers a canonical example of how local governments can be a helping hand to the local economy under certain conditions. As most SOEs and TVEs were privatized, the local government-business relationship entered into a new era where local governments foster strategic coalitions with private firms and joint-ventures, and local leaders and businesspeople shake hands and gain from trade to improve economic performance and profits, ultimately enhancing local leaders' chances of winning in growth-based promotion tournaments.

Chapter 9 synthesizes the theoretical constructs developed in previous chapters, administrative subcontracting and political tournaments, into a unified theoretical framework. These two institutional arrangements are complementary and mutually supporting, creating de facto regional decentralization in a system of central control, strong fiscal incentives, and career concerns for local officials. This analytical framework is used to explain the centralization-decentralization paradox in China's central-local relations. The success of China's economic reforms and development derives from the construction of a new Chinese style of local government governance, which is rooted in traditional political institutions dating back to ancient times. Top Chinese leaders, especially Deng Xiaoping, geared Chinese reforms towards activating and enabling the traditional elements of China's government governance. Since the late 1970s, state authority has devolved gradually into the hands of local governments. A system of“fiscal-sharing contracts”between the central and provincial governments were implemented and continuously revised over time. The criterion for official promotion has shifted from political loyalty during the Mao regime to local economic growth since the Deng regime. As a result, Chinese local leaders have to compete for improved economic performance in order to get a better chance of promotion than their political rivals. All of these reforms empowered local officials with authority, discretion, and fiscal resources, motivating them to seek all possible ways to boost local economies in order to secure promotion. However, current government governance has its own weakness and is responsible for local governments' soft budget constraint, bureaucratic corruption, and localism in legal enforcement. The last section of this chapter discusses the strengths and weaknesses of China's state capacity from the perspective of the complementarity between administrative subcontracting and promotion tournaments.

The book's final chapter discusses the ongoing governance transition of China's local governments. China's time-honored government governance structure is facing serious challenges and undergoing profound changes. For instance, the territorially-based administrative subcontracting system gave local governments too much authority to protect their own interests at the expense of national interests and has led to regional segmentation of national public goods provision, such as local market protectionism and localization of social security, law enforcement, and other public services suitable for central provision. Growth-based promotion tournaments have caused distorted incentives for local officials to damage natural environments and under-supply public services that are in high demand. China's traditional government governance is seriously constrained by the costs of collecting information about local officials' behavior, since a politically centralized regime only allows for vertical, hierarchical monitoring and disables the monitoring of local governments by citizens, independent media, and checks and balances from the legislature and judicial systems. China is now moving towards the rule of law, increasing the voices of public media, people's congresses and political consultative conferences in local governments, and experiments in elections and political campaigns within the Chinese Communist Party. As the information constraint facing the central government is relaxed, we observe an interesting shift in China's government governance from traditional administrative subcontracting, which stresses de facto decentralization and market-oriented incentives, towards Weberian bureaucracy, which emphasizes accountability, procedural justice, rule of law, and centralization of authority and budgetary control. This movement is in stark contrast with the“New Public Management”movement, which calls for a shift from Weberian bureaucracy to the market-incentive-based contracting system. How China's new governance will balance the trade-off between accountability and local officials' incentives remains to be seen.

The appendix provides theoretical background for the economic analysis in the book. It briefly reviews the economic theories of incentives, organizations and governance, and their applications in government organizations. It also introduces and discusses the theories of decentralization, fiscal federalism and political tournaments. These theoretical constructs both inspire and enable our analysis in this book.

# 1 导论

## 1.1 地方政府与中国经济增长之谜

中国经济自改革开放以来保持了30多年的高速增长,被世人誉为“增长奇迹”。自现代以来,世界上除了中国还没有任何一个大国能在如此长的时段保持如此高的增长速度。日本战后的高速经济增长也只持续了20年。中国的GDP总量2010年赶超日本,成为仅次于美国的世界第二大经济体,四年之后已两倍于日本的经济总量。2010年中国赶超美国成为世界第一大制造国,美国保持第一大制造国的记录长达110年之久。与此同时,中国经济的国际竞争力大幅度提高,从一个基本处于封闭状态的计划经济体成长为高度开放、高度竞争的经济体。2007年中国外贸总量超过亚洲排名第二、第三位的日本及韩国之和;2009年出口总额达到1.2万亿美元,取代德国成为世界第一大出口国;2013年进出口贸易总额高达4.16万亿美元,取代美国成为全球最大贸易国。截至2016年4月底,中国的外汇储备高达3.22万亿美元,雄居世界第一。过去30多年,中国的经济发展让6亿人口脱离贫困,这是人类历史上最大规模的脱贫记录。

一种流行的观点认为,中国经济增长迅速是因为中国经济的起点低,人均收入低下,农业和农村的人口比重高,拥有大量廉价劳动力,这些事实都说明中国的增长潜力巨大,因此高速增长不足为奇。这种观点其实不值一驳:按照这种逻辑,全世界增长最快的国家应该出现在最落后的非洲国家,而不是中国。经济学家很早就认识到,经济贫困是一种自我循环的低水平陷阱,如果不借助大推进的力量,彻底走出贫困是非常困难的(Rosenstein-Rodan, 1943)。在巨大的增长潜力与持续高速的增长现实之间如同鸿沟壕堑,显然需要惊险的跳跃才能跨越。自二战以来,完成这种跳跃的国家为数不多,问题是为什么只有少数国家能够完成这样惊险的跳跃?

另外一种观点认为,中国经济增长是完全靠高投资、高投入支撑的,言下之意这是一种廉价的低效率增长。高水平的资本积累率是任何低收入国家实现高速增长所依赖的,许多低收入国家长期发展迟缓所对应的事实恰好是投资不足。我们要回答的问题是:为什么中国能够维持如此高的投资率水平?更重要的是,一些实证研究表明,中国高速经济增长不单单靠物质资本增长,全要素生产率的快速增长也是其中的重要源泉(Zhu, 2012;Liu, 2015)。这就解释了为什么中国所经历的不仅是经济总量的增长,人均收入水平也实现了奇迹般的增长。

我们需要看到,与中国经济增长相伴随的是一个艰难的制度转型和市场化过程。中国从一个高度集中、高度管制的计划经济体制向市场经济为主导的经济体制转变,企业、投资、外贸、金融等方方面面的体制改革绝非自动发生,每一步改革推动都需要精心的政策设计和有效的政策执行,更需要打破既得利益格局的勇气和魄力。中国在改革开放之初不仅经济起点低,更重要的问题是旧体制的束缚多、负担重,在这种情况下如何通过体制改革启动和支撑中国的经济赶超是一项极其严峻的挑战。20世纪90年代初以来,俄罗斯、东欧等转型国家也进行了艰难的经济改革,而成功转型且实现经济持续增长的例子并不多见。虽然中国的经济改革尚未完成,近些年更是进入改革深水区,但中国渐进改革所取得的巨大成就是国际公认的。

基于道格拉斯·诺思的开创性贡献(North and Thomas,1971;North,1981),近年来经济学家开始关注制度尤其是经济和政治制度对经济增长的重要作用。物质和人力资本的增长以及技术进步被认为只是增长的结果,而不是增长的内在源泉,更深层次的决定因素是一国的制度安排。大量的研究表明一国的司法制度对金融市场和经济的发展有着巨大影响,而政府的结构以及政府面临的权力约束也同样影响经济增长(Shleifer and Vishny,1993;Delong and Shleifer,1993;La Porta et al.,1998)。近年来以阿西莫格鲁(Acemoglu)为代表的经济学家通过一系列开创性的理论与实证研究进一步揭示了产权保护制度和包容性政治制度对于长期经济增长的关键性意义。[^1] 然而,这些重要文献的相继问世愈加凸显出中国高速增长的悖论性质。正像Allen等(2005)指出的那样,按照西方主流文献所列出的评判标准,如La Porta等(1998)和Levine(2002)给出的标准,中国目前的司法及其相关制度,如投资者保护、公司治理、会计标准和政府质量均排在世界大多数国家的后面。但是,中国在过去三十多年一直是世界上增长速度最快的国家之一,这又如何解释呢?

中国增长故事的“非常规”性质反映在过去一系列观察中国经济而产生的各种令人困惑的判断与预测上。在某种意义上,中国经济是伴随着各种版本的关于中国经济崩溃的预测而顽强成长的。从美国农业经济学家莱斯特·布朗(Lester Brown)于1994年发表的名噪一时的著作《谁来养活中国》( Who Will Feed China?: Wake-Up Call for a Small Planet ),到投行经济学家章家敦2001年出版的《即将崩溃的中国》( The Coming Collapse of China ),再到2010年以来国外经济学家关于房地产泡沫令中国经济崩溃的种种预测,你方唱罢我登场,不一而足。当然,中国经济的活力和韧性让所有这些惊世预言相形见绌。

2014年瑞士世界经济论坛发布了《全球竞争力报告2014—2015》,中国在144个经济体中排名28位,与韩国和以色列相近。同一年世界银行发布了针对189个经济体的企业经营便利指数(Ease of Doing Business),中国被排在了96位,位于俄罗斯和牙买加之后,与所罗门群岛、纳米比亚比肩,这显然与世界第二大经济体的身份很不相符。在一些分项指标上中国的排名更是让人吃惊:建筑许可185位,开办企业158位,税收缴纳120位,获取电力119位,投资者保护98位。很显然,这两份国际机构的报告对于中国经济的评价相去甚远,如何协调这两者的分歧是一项挑战性的工作。

上述讨论是不是意味着产权保护、司法、金融体系、政商环境等制度安排就不重要了呢?制度安排显然是重要的,因为任何投资、尤其是私人投资都需要在一定的激励下发生。如果投资人感觉到资产安全性无法保证,投资收益随时可能被剥夺,投资的热情就一定会下降,甚至消失。William Easterly(2005)指出,经济增长需要提供“合适的激励”才会发生,因为人们确实对激励做出反应。而影响这一激励的任何因素都会最终影响经济增长。根据这个观点,中国经济高速增长,尤其是对于产权保护和投资环境极为敏感的民间投资和外商投资一路高歌猛进,其背后一定有与之相对应的强大激励和提供这些激励的制度安排。问题的关键在于,中国提供这些激励的制度安排具备很多“本土”特色,与西方世界的标准范式大相径庭。

为了解释中国的经济增长,我们必须寻找那些具有中国特色的支持经济增长的制度安排。我们把观察的视角投向了中国的政府治理,尤其是地方政府的独特作用。众所周知,改革开放以来,地方政府在区域经济增长中扮演了极为重要的角色。中国地方官员对于招商引资、谋求区域经济发展的热情在世界范围内都是罕见的。为了吸引外部投资,促进企业成长,地方官员投入巨资修建基础设施,提供各种优惠政策,不断优化招商环境。这方面的努力集中体现在经济技术开发区、高新技术开发区等各类开发区的建设和运营上。截至2014年6月,中国共有439家国家级开发区[^2] ,1627家省级开发区,425家市级开发区,以及数以千计的县乡级开发区。[^3] 有系统的实证研究表明,经济开发区显著提高了全要素生产率,增加了外商投资、就业和工人收入,促进了城市的经济集聚和商业发展(Wang, 2013;Zheng et al., 2015)。

20世纪90年代以来席卷全国的“经营城市”运动也是由地方政府发起的,反映了地方官员在更高的层面上寻求城市发展和经济增长的动力。“经营城市”以撬动土地价值和盘活城市资产为核心理念,改造城市的结构和功能,大规模修建城市基础设施,彻底抛弃长期以来依靠单一财政投入和政府经营的城建模式,使城市的公共基础设施和经济活力大为改观。当然,经营城市在土地拆迁、文物和生态保护等方面也暴露出诸多问题,饱受争议。但是我们需要看到其积极的一面,即在没有显著增加社会税收负担的情况下,地方政府主要利用土地有偿使用和转让制度,在相对短的时间里完成了绝大多数城市的改造和重建任务,建立了高度发达的城市基础设施和跨区域的交通运输网络,为中国经济的持久增长打下了坚实的物质基础。

地方政府不仅是区域经济发展的直接推动者,同时也是改革开放过程中破解集权体制弊端、引领制度创新的关键力量。过去30多年中国绝大多数的重要改革都是由地方政府发起、推动和直接参与的,这构成中国改革进程中最亮丽的风景线。作为中国改革起点的农村联产承包责任制就是安徽省凤阳县小岗村的18名村干部和村民冒着生命危险率先发起,从县委书记、地委书记到省委书记,顶着各种政治压力,最终得以在安徽全省推行,然后引发全国效仿,中国农村经济改革的序幕就此拉开。

经济特区一直以来是中国改革开放的“窗口”和“桥头堡”,被公认为中国渐进式改革的伟大创造。特区最初是由当时的广东省委向中央提出的一个大胆设想,得到邓小平等国家领导人的鼎力支持。经济特区无数成功的改革实践,如中外合资企业的创立、外贸体制的改革、用工制度改革、土地有偿使用转让、行政体制改革、地方大部制改革等等,都是先在特区尝试和探索,然后经中央层面的总结和宣传在全国推广。这里尤其需要提及80年代初在深圳特区开创的土地有偿使用制度,突破了计划经济时代国有土地计划调拨、无偿使用的制度,可谓是中国城市土地管理制度最重要的变革。然而,深圳特区最早借鉴香港的土地批租制度,向部分土地征收使用费,这一做法在当时具有突破传统政策法律框架的性质。正是深圳特区的成功创举直接推动了1988年我国关于土地使用制度的宪法修正。

由计划经济时期的社队企业演变而来的乡镇企业开创了中国农村工业化的独特道路,一度在中国工业中占有“半壁江山”,曾经被邓小平誉为“异军突起”,而它们就是由乡镇政府、村委会所有、乡村干部直接或间接经营的农村集体企业。80年代这些乡镇企业被排斥在计划经济体制之外,人才、资金、原材料、销售渠道无法像国有企业那样从国家计划获取,都需要自己想办法解决;每逢国家宏观调控之时乡镇企业都是被政策打压和整顿的对象。就是在如此艰难的制度环境下,乡镇企业凭借优于国有企业的生产和经营效率顽强生长,对中国的工业化做出了重要贡献。

在改革早期,农村的私人企业在当时的经济体制和政治环境下面临严重的歧视和约束,从国家政策、意识形态到原材料购买、产品销售,都没有给予私人企业多少生存空间。因为在国家工商部门无法注册,私营企业没有合法身份,连签合同的公章都没有。然而,正是在乡镇政府的“默许”下,这些私营企业被戴上了“集体企业”的“红帽子”。温州地区的地方政府大胆创新,为这些非公有制企业量身定做了一个新名字——“股份合作制企业”,使其在国家工商部门获得了合法身份。

1998年中央提出“抓大放小”的改革思路,全国开始了大规模的国企改制,然而其最早的尝试始于1993年山东诸城的股份制改革。山东诸城当时的市委书记陈光为了摆脱国企大面积亏损的困局,在一年的时间里“变卖”了全市272家国有(集体)企业,因此获得了“陈卖光”的称号。诸城国企改革经媒体曝光之后立刻引起了全国范围的巨大争议,作为改革者的陈光面临空前的压力。1996年中央派出联合调查组进驻诸城进行调查,最后的结论是诸城改革为“放活国有小企业”创造了宝贵经验。

从小岗村改革到给私营企业戴“红帽子”,从土地有偿使用到国企股份制改革,所有这些重大改革的开启者在当时的制度和政策环境下均面临巨大的政治风险,在他们身上体现了政治企业家的冒险和创新精神。

然而,如果我们把目光转向发展中国家和转型国家,不难发现许多国家的政府表现并不令人满意。在世界银行长期从事发展问题研究的著名经济学家威廉·伊斯特利(William Easterly)曾经尖锐地指出,在影响经济增长的各种因素中,政府是头号杀手,政府的无能、腐败和低效率对经济增长产生了致命的危害,导致许多发展中国家经济增长长期迟缓(Easterly,2005)。为什么中国的地方政府能有这么高的激励去推动地方的经济增长?为什么在大多数的发展中国家很难激励政府官员积极作为,推动当地的经济发展,而中国能做到这一点?中国如何解决地方官员的激励与政府有为的问题?

当然,中国的高速经济增长也导致了一系列经济社会问题,有些问题长期积累,不断恶化,引起社会高度关注,如粗放型增长、收入分配不公、地区差异、环境污染、医疗保障体系落后、官员腐败、地方保护主义等等问题。这些问题的长期存在威胁着中国经济的可持续发展。从根源上看,所有这些问题都属于政府公共服务不足和缺位,是“政府失效”的产物,与地方官员的激励和行为有着千丝万缕的内在联系。如果我们认为地方政府和官员在中国经济增长中扮演了极其重要的角色,那么这一系列经济社会问题又是如何与我国官员激励和政府治理的模式联系在一起的呢?

本书试图系统地回答上述这些问题,侧重从地方官员的激励和政府治理的视角,揭示中国高速经济增长所依赖的政经条件和制度基础,提供一种关于中国经济增长的政治经济学解释。在这种解释中,我们强调中国解决政府官员激励和政府治理问题的独特方式以及地方官员在其中扮演的独特角色。沿着同样的视角,我们还将看到中国经济增长所带来的各种问题产生的制度性根源。

针对中国经济增长面临的各种问题,中央及时提出了一系列新的施政理念,旨在转变经济增长方式,缩小地区差异,保护生态环境,让经济增长的成果能够惠及广大民众,走共同富裕的道路。为了更好地实现中国的经济转型,我们必须深入理解传统增长模式的激励和制度基础,其中地方官员的激励和政府治理无疑是其中最为关键的一部分。我们希望本书可以为设计中国经济转型所需的激励机制提供重要启示。

## 1.2 地方政府的独特地位

我国共有23个省、5个自治区、4个直辖市和2个特别行政区。截至2014年底,省以下行政区划(不包括台湾省、香港和澳门特别行政区)包括:333个地市级单位(其中地级市288个),2854个县级单位和40381个乡镇单位。过去30多年全国地市级单位数和县级单位保持了高度的稳定性。

为了理解地方政府在中国行政体制和中国经济当中的独特地位和作用,我们可以先看一组数字,以获得一些初步的概念。首先,让我们看改革开放以来地方政府(包括从省到乡镇的各级地方政府)的收支总规模在全国GDP当中所占的比重。为了便于对比,我们也列出了中央财政收支占全国GDP的比重,结果见图1.1。

从图1.1我们可以看到几个有趣的事实。首先,在过去30多年的时间里,地方政府财政收入规模占全国GDP的比重经历了一个先下降后上升的过程,从1978年的26%一路下降到1994年的5%—6%。分税制改革之后,地方政府收入的比重开始缓慢上升,到了2014年已经达到12%的水平。其次,地方政府财政支出占GDP的比重在1994年之前总体上是下降的,1997年触底之后出现了较大幅度的上升,2014年已经超过20%。相比之下,如图1.1(b)所示,中央财政收入占GDP的比例在经历1984—1993年的大幅下降之后触底反弹,从1993年的不到4%上升至2014年的10%。但是,中央财政支出占GDP的比重在整个改革过程中是一个明显的下降过程,从改革之初的14%降至2014年的4%左右。这说明分税制改革对于地方政府来说,无论是财政汲取能力还是所承担的公共职责都是一个分水岭。随着市场化进程和改革开放的深入,我们并没有看到地方政府从中国经济中大规模退出。这是一个值得注意和研究的现象,我们后面还会讨论这一点。再次,我们可以注意到,相对中央政府而言,中国地方政府的收支占GDP的规模一直是较高的。

为了更清楚地界定中央政府和地方政府相对规模的大小,我们绘制了图1.2。[^4] 如图1.2所示,改革开放以来,地方政府的财政支出占全国财政支出的比例平均维持在70%以上。虽然1994年分税制改革之后,地方政府的财政收入占全国财政收入的比例从以前的最高点——接近80%骤然降至不足50%,但是,80年代中期以来地方财政支出的比例却一直处于较高水平,2000年之后继续增加,近年来更是高达85%。地方政府的财政支出占比高达70%以上,从国际比较的角度看,这是非常罕见的。

学者通常采用两个指标描述一个国家政府规模的大小。第一个指标是政府所控制的财政支出,第二个指标是政府的人员规模。我们在图1.2中已经看到中国地方政府在整个政府系统中占据极其重要的地位。中国地方政府在人员规模上又有何特征呢?

图1.3列出了1989—2014年省区国家行政机关人数占省区总人口的比例,每一年的比例是以各省区的人口数作为权重对各省区的数字进行加权平均获得的。[^5] 一个惊人的事实是,2005年之前这个比例实际上有一个高度稳定的趋势值,大约0.86%,即100个人当中政府机关雇员不足1人。2005年以后这个比例逐年增加,到2014年底,100个人当中政府机关雇员超过1人。分别按人员规模和财政支出统计地方政府的相对规模都指向一个共同的事实,就是在中国经济社会经历大转型的过程中地方政府的地位保持了惊人的稳定性。

我们还想知道地方政府相对于中央政府的相对人员规模。根据最近可得的数据,截止到2011年,在全国所有政府公务员当中,中央公务员所占比例非常有限,不到7%,而剩下93%都是地方政府所雇佣的公务员(楼继伟,2013)。这个数字包含了事业单位的人数。如果我们利用《北京市统计年鉴》和《中国劳动统计年鉴》提供的数据计算中央和地方政府机关的人数,地方政府所占的比例更大。图1.4列出了1989—2008年中央政府机关人数占全国政府机关人数的比例。[^6] 这个比例的最高值(1989年)只有1.68%,1998年国家机关改革之后还大幅度下降,跌至不足0.5%。对于中国这样一个中央高度集权的国家,在政务人员和财政支出上,我们却看到地方政府占据了极高的一个比例。从国际比较的角度看,地方政府在这两个方面所体现出来的相对重要性都是非常惊人的。[^7]

中国高度集中的行政体制容易给人造成一种假象:在中央集权之下,作为中央政府的代理人,地方政府只是中央政策和命令的忠实执行者,不享有什么特殊的地位和角色。然而,这是关于中国行政体制的最大误解。

即使在计划经济体制时期,中国比苏联更为分权,地方政府所控制的计划指标和地方工业规模所占比例均远高于后者(Qian and Xu,1993)。图1.2也清楚地表明,在计划经济的后期(1978年),地方政府筹集的财政收入远远大于中央政府,地方政府的财政支出也多于中央政府。美国著名的中国问题专家谢淑丽(Susan Shirk)在一本研究中国改革的政治逻辑的专著中提到,计划经济时期中国中央计划控制的产品种类数只有600个,而苏联是5500个(Shirk,1993,p.13)。在改革开放之初,中国2000多个县几乎都拥有生产农机的国有企业,300个县有钢铁厂,20多个省的国有企业生产汽车或拖拉机的整机或配件。各地小型国有企业生产的化肥和水泥分别占全国化肥和水泥总产量的69%和59%,这与所有其他的计划经济体制国家形成鲜明对比(许成钢,2008)。也就是说,中国绝大多数产品的计划和配置权是高度分散在各级地方政府手里,离开了地方政府对于产品生产和物质调配的计划、融资和管理,中央计划几乎寸步难行。在这个意义上,与苏联相比,中国所谓的计划经济应该更准确地称为“地方计划主义”体制。在80年代以前的中国,中央直接控制了大约13000个职位任命,而在苏联这个数字是51000个(Burns,1987)。这说明在人事任命上中国的地方政府也一直握有重要的权力。

进入改革开放时期,地方政府的地位更加特殊,作用更加巨大。80年代初,行政性分权和财政包干制促成了行政权、经济管理权和财权向地方政府的全面下放,经济特区、沿海经济技术开发区的相继成立进一步削弱了中央计划部门的权力,强化了地方政府经济决策的自主地位和影响力。从1984年开始,中国进行干部人事制度改革,由原来的“下管两级”改为“下管一级”,即中央只直接负责省部级干部的任命,省级政府全权负责省内地市级干部人事的选拔和任命。在中国的行政体制当中,人事任免权从来都是最核心的权力,它的下放意味着地方政府控制力的巨大提升。

崔之元教授提出,应该借用亚里斯多德政治学理论中的“三分法”,即“一人”(君主)、“少数”(贵族)、“多数”(大众),把中国政治分成“三层”,即中央政府、地方政府和民众,以区别于时下流行的“国家—市民社会”的“两分法”。[^8] 这三层之间可以相互制约,建立良性互动的关系,比如中央联合民众制约地方政府,而地方政府也变成制约中央过度集权的重要力量。“三层”分析方法不再把所有政府都放在一起作为一个利益一致的整体面对社会,而是突出了地方政府在中国的政治体制当中相对独立的力量,说明在中国现有的政治体制下有可能找到一种独特的利益制衡机制。

但是,为什么地方政府在中国的行政体制下可以成为相对独立的力量,制约中央的过度集权,推动中国的改革开放进程和经济发展呢?对于这个问题,崔之元教授没有说明。他提出的“三层法”是一种规范的分析,即回答“应该怎样”的问题。为了理解中国地方政府的独特地位,我们还需要进一步做实证的分析,回答“是什么”和“为什么”的问题。

随着地方政府权力的不断上升,中央和地方的关系更多演变成了一种协商、谈判的关系,中央在做出重大决策之前经常向地方政府广泛征求意见,认真听取各方的反映,在得到大多数地方政府的理解、同意和支持之后才付诸实施(Shirk,1993)。这方面的一个例子是分税制改革。1993年,鉴于财政包干制下中央的相对收入比重大幅下降,中央决定实施分税制改革,以大幅度提高中央财政收入占GDP的比重和占全国财政收入的比重。分税制将直接伤害一些发达省份的利益,改革遇到的地方阻力较大。为了说服地方大员,时任国务院常务副总理的朱镕基带领中央相关部委的领导,分赴各地,与省市领导一对一谈判。与一些发达省份的谈判因分歧太大,一度陷入僵局(谢庆奎等,1998)。经过多轮艰苦的谈判和协商,中央做出了巨大让步,比如实行税收返还制度,保证各个省、市、自治区在1994年的财政收入不低于1993年的水平,还有其他一些安抚措施,分税制才顺利实施。[^9] 2006年开启的医疗体制改革也是一个中央部委之间、中央与地方以及社会各界参与的一个协商谈判、建立共识的过程(王绍光、樊鹏,2013)。通过谈判协商达成共识的决策机制有助于多方利益的表达,集思广益,更好地实现多方利益的平衡,避免了过去完全依赖少数人的政治意志决定政策的局面。

本书后面将会详细分析,中国虽然是一个政治上高度集权的国家,但因为在传统上中央把几乎所有的事务均委托地方政府具体实施,事权高度集中于地方政府。除了国防和外交之外,中央离开了地方政府寸步难行,这本身就形成了中央和地方的一种合作和利益制衡机制。改革开放以来地方分权不断深化,地方政府获得了大量的行政权、经济管理权和财权,进一步加固了地方政府在中央面前的谈判地位。

改革开放以来中国推行了以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛,地方官员的晋升与当地经济绩效紧密挂钩(周黎安,2004,2007;Li and Zhou,2005;周黎安等,2005;Xu,2011)。这意味着经济发展快的地区更可能有干部升任到中央部门(Maskin et al.,2000)。人们也注意到,改革开放以来各届中央委员会的人员构成中来自地方的中央委员的比例有上升之势。以党的十七大选举产生的中央政治局委员为例。在25名政治局委员当中,一共有20名成员曾经担任过省级领导职务,其中18名担任过省、市、自治区的一把手,13名不止在一个省区做过省级领导。在9位政治局常委当中就有8位曾经担任过省、市、自治区的一把手。目前的政治晋升机制保证了中央核心决策机构当中大多数成员有过地方政府的工作经历,加上中央一直强调的集体领导原则,这些制度安排都有助于实现中央和地方利益的协调和平衡。

在中国多层级、多地区的政府间关系中,中央政府和地方政府有着不同的目标函数和利益诉求。中央更关心宏观经济的走势,全局的利益平衡和全社会的民生福利状况,而地方政府更关心辖区内的财政资源的多少、经济发展的状况以及公众的就业和民生情况,较少关注其经济决策的外溢效应以及其他地区的公众福利。两者面临的资源和制度约束也很不一样。下面我们讨论几个重要方面的差异。

比如,对于改革开放经常遇到的意识形态方面的争论,地方政府所面临的意识形态的压力比中央政府要小得多。上世纪80—90年代关于改革“姓社姓资”的讨论,更多是在中央层面上进行,而地方政府参与较少。在经济资源方面,地方政府手中拥有的财政、金融和企业资源远不如中央政府。中央政府控制货币发行,可以直接发行国债,控制关系国计民生的大型央企;而地方政府不能控制国有商业银行,地方政府直接举债长时间以来是禁止的,近年来有所松动。在竞争约束方面,就全国性公共产品的供给(如国防),中央政府如同一个完全的垄断者,而提供地方性公共产品的地方政府因为在经济增长、财政资源和吸引外资方面的竞争而引发基础设施、行政服务、宜居环境等诸多方面的激烈竞争。在信息约束方面,相比中央政府,地方政府拥有更多的私人或局部信息,比如辖区企业和居民的偏好。在执行中央政策方面,地方政府直接决定和影响政策执行的方向、力度和效果,其中不可避免地加入地方政府自己的利益和算计,中央政府要监督各地具体执行情况非常困难。还有一个值得强调的差异:地方政府更可能被当地的企业和精英集团“利益捕获”,而这些利益集团要“捕获”中央政府则困难得多(Bardhan et al., 2000)。

中央和地方政府在目标函数与约束条件的结构性差异,决定了两者之间在激励和行为方面的诸多不同。如果要深刻理解地方政府在中国改革开放和经济发展过程中所扮演的独特角色,就必须从这些结构性差异出发。正如前面提到的,中国的许多重要改革都是由地方政府发起、推动或直接参与,比如农村改革、经济特区、给私营企业戴“红帽子”、乡镇企业异军突起、土地有偿使用、国企改制等等,其中一些改革尝试在早期与中央政策相抵触,遇到了中央层面的阻力,但因为地方政府大胆坚持和巧妙周旋才被中央所认可,最后作为成功的改革经验在全国范围内推广。当然,地方政府也经常做一些有利于局部利益但损害全局利益的事情,如经济开发区的泛滥成灾,造成环境破坏和耕地消失等。一些地方政府“上有政策,下有对策”,导致“政令不出中南海”,使中央政策在地方上彻底变形。地方政府与中央政府周旋与博弈就是因为地方政府有独立的利益诉求,有实现自我利益的手段和条件(例如掌握中央下放的权力、利用中央政府监督的困难);此外,地方政府之间的激烈竞争,也迫使地方政府推陈出新,有时不惜违反中央政策去赢得先机。

## 1.3 从政府激励到官员激励

对于企业的经理和普通员工,只有给予适当的激励他们才可能努力工作。对于政府部门的官员,合适的激励同样重要。而在一个政府居于经济社会枢纽和中心地位的国家,政府官员的激励则更为重要。

我们关注地方政府及官员的激励,是因为它触及政府治理的一个核心方面。政府治理的特征源于政府官员的自由裁量权和政府所从事的公共职责的特殊性质。当政府权力不受或较少受到约束时,政府官员拥有巨大的随意处置权,而这些权力因为公共服务的垄断性以及国家暴力机器的支持而容易变成“合法伤害权”。[^10] 虽然市场个体消费者或企业也可能拥有一定的合法伤害权(如逆向选择和道德风险),但在影响范围和程度上与政府相比不可同日而语。换句话说,政府官员既可以成事,也可坏事,这就是文献里著名的“掠夺之手”与“帮助之手”的区别(Frye and Shelifer,1997)。另一方面,政府职责具有多维度、多任务的特征且不易量化(Tirole,1994),政府目标需要同时考虑诸如经济发展、公众福利、社会公正、环境污染等多重目标,有些目标容易考核(如经济发展),有些目标难以量化(如社会公正),目标之间还可能存在潜在冲突(如经济发展与环境保护之间)。政府权力的合法伤害潜力、政府目标的多维性及量化的困难使得激励政府官员成为各国行政治理的难题。

在中国,政府官员手中的自由裁量权更具特殊性:一是行政权力巨大,经济社会的方方面面都在行政的监管和控制之下;二是权力所受的约束有限(如“一把手”现象),政府经常被形容为“闲不住的手”。中国长期以来流行的属地化分级管理模式也赋予了地方政府重要的经济与社会的治理权,而这些权力主要靠上级政府的监督和制约,但因为信息不对称,使得垂直监督非常困难。而了解政府所作所为的群体,如企业、居民和媒体,又缺乏监督的权力。过去30多年的市场化改革已经显著改变了我国资源配置的方式,许多计划控制(如投资、外贸、原材料分配)被取消了,市场的作用不断上升,但是,政府仍然牢牢控制着关键性经济资源(如资金、土地、产业政策、经营环境)。地方政府是区域内资源的掌控者和规则的制定者,一个企业经营者所需的生产要素和政策环境都不同程度地受到地方政府的控制和影响。如果政府官员只关心权力租金,向企业收取贿赂;或者乱作为,干扰企业正常经营;或者懒政不作为,那么,当地经济和社会的发展就会遇上严重障碍,甚至被扼杀。从这个意义上讲,一个区域的经济发展如果离开了地方政府的支持和推动是难以想象的。

政府治理的核心就在于设计一个合理的激励机制,阻止自由裁量权演变成合法伤害权,将“掠夺之手”转化成“帮助之手”,实现政府官员个人利益与政府治理目标之间的激励兼容。因此,我们需要把中国的官员激励和政府治理作为一个专门的研究领域去认识和解析。我们不能仅仅局限在政府职能转变的必要性和理想路径的讨论上,而是需要首先揭示现实中官员激励和政府运行的微观机制及其影响。如果不打开政府这个“黑箱”,我们就不可能真正理解政府部门发生的种种系统现象,也无法真正理解政府治理转型的困难所在和未来方向。

东亚经济的崛起引发了经济学家和政治学家关于经济发展过程中政府职能的重新思考和激烈辩论。从80年代开始,有一种所谓的“发展型国家理论”(developmental state theory)在政治学界影响很大(Johnson,1982;Amsden,1989;Wade,1990)。这种观点认为,一些东亚国家和地区的经济崛起,如日本、韩国和中国台湾,在于政府有意识的干预,用政府干预替代市场失效;通过精心设计的产业政策和财政补贴政策故意扭曲价格(getting the prices wrong),使一些具有战略性意义的行业得以发展,最后实现国家工业化和经济赶超。经济学家则从东亚经济的崛起中看到了市场化的力量。1993年世界银行发表了一份著名的研究报告,认为东亚经济的成功在于综合使用了市场导向和政府引导的政策,如自由竞争、出口导向、减少政府管制,从而实现了资本积累、资源有效配置和技术赶超(World Bank,1993)。与“发展型国家理论”不同,世界银行不认为政府替代市场是东亚经济奇迹的唯一经验,东亚国家和地区也采取了很多政府政策促进和完善市场的协调作用,关键还是在于“把价格搞对”(getting the prices right)。

上述争论把政府和市场当做对立面,两者之间要么是政府取代市场,要么市场替代政府。Aoki等(1997)指出,发展型国家理论和世界银行的观点都忽略了一个基本事实:政府不是一个中立和万能的代理人,不能把政府想象成可以根据政策目标的需要自动纠正市场失灵。政府也是这个过程内生的参与人,它面临着特定的信息和激励约束,而这些信息与激励约束决定政府政策干预的性质和效果。换句话说,政府官员在具体实施产业政策时不一定自动按照社会最优的方式行事,他们可能秉公行事,也可能滥用权力,谋取私利,这取决于他们具体面临的信息和激励约束。所以要理解东亚的经济成功,还必须深入到东亚经济中政府治理和政府官员的激励方式。这是一个重要的思想转变,从强调政府替代市场到强调政府官员激励和政府治理的意义。如前所述,Easterly(2005)反思了半个世纪以来发展中国家的经济增长过程,认为强调“把价格搞对”只是一个方面,关键是“把激励搞对”,如何赋予广大的参与人合适的激励,而其中政府的激励尤其重要。

与东亚国家相比,中国的改革开放和经济发展所面临的政府与市场问题更为特殊,政府与市场的关系也更为复杂和微妙。中国长期推行计划经济,它所遗留下来的经济监管和调控制度(如行政审批、额度分配、价格管制)与市场经济的运行逻辑严重抵触,市场生长发育面临制度和政策环境的重重阻力。在改革开放的过程中,国有企业长期占据了中国经济的主体地位,民营企业从制度的夹缝中成长,意识形态、政策、法律和管制条例长期以来歧视民营企业,市场发展所需的基础设施(包括硬件和软件)供给不足。即使到了今天,相比国有企业,民营企业在市场准入、融资、产权保护等诸多方面仍然遇到各种各样的制度障碍,政府官员对市场和民营企业的“乱作为”时有发生。

对于中国的经济转型与发展来说,政府和市场的关系不是简单的市场失灵或政府失灵的问题,也不是政府替代市场还是市场替代政府的选择问题。目前所有关于市场与政府关系的讨论都隐含了一个假定,即已经存在一个正常运行的市场以及与之配套的基本制度条件;在此基础之上,给定市场与政府的潜在功能与缺陷,然后考虑是让市场还是让政府在经济中发挥更多的作用。这个假定既不构成中国经济发展和市场化进程的历史起点,也不是构筑中国政府与市场关系的逻辑起点。中国面临的现实处境是,市场脱胎于计划经济体制,一直在政府管制和权力干预的“包裹”之下运行和发展,市场和政府“相互纠缠”在一起。关键在于如何打破制度束缚,为市场松绑助力,推动市场化进程和区域经济发展。市场本身无法为自己松绑,这一切还需要依靠政府主导去完成。在中国,最吊诡的事实是,市场化本身如果离开了有为政府几乎寸步难行,市场化所需的“去政府化”和“去行政化”是通过政府推动甚至“自我革命”来完成的。在这个意义上,中国的市场化改革,乃至于整个经济发展,如同“与虎谋皮”,这里的“老虎”就是地方政府,因为政策、管制、经济资源都掌握在各级政府手里,如何让“老虎”愿意拿出自己的“皮肉”推动市场和企业的发展,其艰难程度可想而知。我们不能盼望市场从天而降,更不能盼望市场化所需的政府改革从天而降,这一切都内生于中国的经济发展的过程,内生于官员激励和政府治理的制度框架之中。因此,如何塑造一个合适的激励体系,使得政府和官员愿意为市场和民营企业提供良好的制度、政策和硬件环境,愿意让渡手里掌握的各种关键性资源支持非国有企业的发展,是中国市场化进程和经济发展面临的关键性问题。

关注政府及官员的激励有助于使我们可以更好地理解官员的行为,为政府治理和相关机制的理性设计提供必要的基础。比如人们常说官场有一个“59岁现象”,即官员在59岁退休之前腐败案高发的现象。这个现象显然不是说人到了59岁就更为贪婪,或者权力监督在这个年龄节点就变得更为松弛,而是临近退休,官员仕途前景激励完全消失,节制的意义不大;与此同时,如果不再趁机“捞一把”权力过期就作废了。“59岁现象”容易理解,可是根据一些媒体报道,在官场同时也出现了所谓的“35岁现象”,即贪腐行为逐渐年轻化。[^11] 这看不上去不可理喻,仕途尚早为什么就开始堕落呢?其实它和“59岁现象”是一个道理。在中国的基层政府,最近十多年流行“退居二线”制度,即未到正式退休年龄就强制“赋闲”在家,或者失去提拔机会,而且这个退居二线年龄越往基层就越年轻,使得一些乡镇干部在35岁如果未能成功晋升到某个职位就可能永远失去未来的晋升机会。[^12] 所以“35岁现象”和“59现象”符合一个相同的逻辑,就是晋升机会的完全丧失导致贪腐动机的上升。在日本,资深政府官员退休之后可以重新被私人部门聘用,“发挥余热”,这在日本被称为“神仙下凡”。退休后获得的高额收入可以补偿在政府部门相对较低的薪水。退休后“神仙下凡”也会对官员在任时的行为产生积极的约束作用,因为他们必须维持良好的声誉,否则会影响其退休后的结果。为了抑制腐败,我们要加强对官员的权力监督,使其在阳光下运行,但与此同时,也决不能忽视官员必要的激励结构的设计。否则,官员在扭曲的激励下行事,对地方经济和社会肯定会产生不利影响。

国内外关于地方政府的研究可谓汗牛充栋,其中关于中国地方政府的研究文献中,最有影响的是钱颖一、Weingast 等学者提出“中国特色的联邦主义”(Federalism,Chinese Style)假说(Montinola et al.,1995;Qian and Weingast,1997;Qian and Roland,1998;Jin et al.,2005)。[^13] 该理论认为,中国地方政府的强激励有两个基本原因,第一个是行政分权,中央政府从80年代初开始就把很多经济管理的权力下放到地方,使地方政府拥有相对自主的经济决策权。第二个是以财政包干为内容的财政分权改革,中央把很多财权下放到地方,而且实施财政包干合同,使得地方可以与中央分享财政收入。财政收入越高,地方的留存就越多,其中预算外收入属于100%的留存。正是行政分权和财政包干使得中国地方政府有充分的激励去维护市场,扶持非国有企业,推动地方经济增长。所以,“中国特色的联邦主义”假说也被表述为市场维护型联邦主义(market-preserving federalism)。Jin等(2005)利用财政包干时期中央与各省财收收入分成比例的差异估计了财税激励对地区经济发展的影响。Kung和Li(2015)利用2000—2002年企业所得税由地方税过渡到中央和地方的分享税带来的税收分成的变化,发现地级市企业所得税分成比例的下降导致工业增长率有所下降,而用于“经营城市”的资源投入(如城市基础设施)增加,土地出让收入上升。

本书的研究视角与“中国特色的财政联邦主义”理论有相似之处,我们都聚焦于地方政府行为背后的激励结构以及政府治理对经济发展的影响。但是我们之间也存在诸多的不同,以下三点最为重要。

首先,财政联邦主义理论假设地方政府的目标函数是最大化可支配的财政收入,突出地方政府作为经济代理人的特征。我们则认为,财政收入固然重要,居于政府体系之中的官员更应该是政治代理人,因而更关注其职位、权力和晋升,晋升激励是官员行为的关键性驱动力。

其次,财政联邦主义理论的分析的基点仍然是作为整体的地方政府,而我们侧重在地方官员的个人特征与行为。财政分成和行政分权都是在中央与地方政府的层面上发生,这里“只见机构不见人”。事实上,地方政府的整体行为是对官员个体的激励和行为进行“加总”的结果,在分析上仍然是一个需要打开的“黑箱”。在中国的制度背景下,地方政府的决策最终也是一些主要地方官员决策的加总结果。为了理解地方政府的决策与行为,我们必须深入理解这些主要地方官员个体层面上的激励与行为。

第三,类似于很多讨论中国央地关系的文献,“中国特色的财政联邦主义”趋向于参照美国政府间关系(如联邦制)看中国的央地关系;而我们想强调的是,中国政府间关系本质上是权威组织内部不同层级间的上下级关系,这是区别于西方国家的一个最重要的制度特征。在美国,联邦与州政府之间不存在权力统属关系,而是由宪法保证的平等的契约关系;即使在单一制的英国,地方政府不享有联邦制下的地方自治地位,但中央和地方政府的关系并不等同于权威组织内的上下级关系。从权威组织的内部层级和上下级关系看中国的央地关系是本书采取的最重要的分析视角。本书所借助的两个基本分析概念——行政发包制和政治锦标赛都是基于这个视角提出的。

强调地方官员的微观激励承袭了经济学一以贯之的个体主义(individualism)方法论传统,即任何集体行为(如政府的决策和行为)或加总的行为(如市场价格的变动、经济增长等)都必须在微观个体(如消费者、企业或政府官员)的水平上进行理解,然后借助合适的均衡概念(如市场均衡或纳什均衡)把这些个体行为“加总”到中观或宏观水平上,然后再对作为均衡现象的集体行为或加总行为进行解释。

本书聚焦于地方官员的晋升激励及其影响,侧重分析地方官员的个体特征和行为,然后在此基础上解释我们在政府层面所观察到的诸多现象及其对经济的影响。这是本书所采用的方法和以往大多数研究地方政府的文献最重要的区别。我们试图理解地方政府的各种行为,如地区竞争、经营城市、地方保护主义、政府间关系、土地财政等等,但是我们把分析的触角伸向地方政府背后的地方官员,分析他们在相关制度环境下的激励和行为,比如财政分成体制下地方政府的财政激励会加强,但政府的财政激励如何和地方官员个人的激励挂钩呢?同样,我们可以问,行政分权会如何和地方官员个人的利益联系起来呢?而本书研究就试图打开政府运行这个黑箱,深入认识地方官员的激励来源及所产生的行为后果。

近年来经济学家开始越来越关注中国政府官员的个体激励,从地方官员的晋升激励研究中国政府内部治理的特征(Blanchard and Shleifer,2001;Maskin et al.,2000;Whiting,2001;Bo,2002;Zhou,2002;周黎安,2004,2007;周黎安等,2005;Li and Zhou,2005;Xu,2011)。这种观点认为,虽然财税激励无疑构成地方政府行为的一个重要动力,但作为处于行政金字塔之中的政府官员,除了关心地方的财政收入之外,自然也关心其在“官场”升迁的机遇,而这种激励在现实中可能是更为重要的动机。中国政府治理的一个重要特点就是将地方官员的晋升与地方经济发展的绩效联系起来,让地方官员为了政治晋升而在经济上相互竞争,形成了政治锦标赛模式(周黎安,2004,2007)。Li和Zhou(2005)、周黎安等(2005)运用中国改革以来的省级水平的数据系统地验证了地方官员晋升与地方经济绩效的显著关联,为地方官员晋升激励的存在提供了重要的经验证据。研究发现,省级官员的升迁概率与省区GDP的增长率呈显著的正相关关系,而且,中央在考核地方官员的绩效时理性地运用相对绩效评估的方法来减少绩效考核的误差,增加其可能的激励效果。周黎安(2004)从晋升激励的角度探讨处于政治晋升博弈之中的中国地方官员的“非合作”倾向,以此解释中国跨区域经济互动上所表现出来的地方保护主义和重复建设问题。周黎安(2007)从中国地方官员激励和治理的角度对中国特有的政府激励模式——政治锦标赛的系统特征及其影响进行了研究。该文认为,政治锦标赛作为中国治理政府官员的激励模式,它是中国经济奇迹的重要根源,但由于政治锦标赛自身的一些缺陷,尤其是其激励官员的目标与政府职能的合理设计之间存在严重冲突,它又是当前经济面临的许多重大问题的重要根源。徐现祥等(2007)和张军、高远(2007)均发现中国省级官员的交流对地区经济增长有正面的影响。傅勇、张晏(2007)发现,财政分权和政府官员的晋升激励导致政府公共支出结构偏向于经济建设而非公共服务和人力资本投资。张军等(2007)发现,在控制了经济发展水平、金融深化以及其他因素之后,地方政府之间在“招商引资”上的标尺竞争和政府治理的转型是解释中国基础设施投资决定的重要因素。

如果说政治锦标赛是本书所依赖的一个分析支点,着重于横向的官场竞争的视角,那么另一个分析支点就是行政发包制,即从中央到地方的纵向视角理解中国的官员激励和政府治理模式。行政发包制这个概念最早在本书的第一版提出来,经过一系列的提炼和发展(周黎安、王娟,2012;周黎安,2014,2016),已经演变成一个比较成熟的分析框架,并用于解析中国政府间关系和治理过程的诸多现象。[^14] 作为一种政府治理形态,行政发包制在三个方面上与韦伯意义上的现代官僚制形成鲜明对照;第一,虽然发包方拥有正式权威和剩余控制权,但在执行发包方的指令过程中承包方享受大量的自由裁量权,甚至实际控制权;第二,在财政和预算安排上,承包方承担相当程度上的自我筹资的任务,具有财政或预算包干制的色彩;第三,在内部控制和绩效考核方面,承包方面临结果导向的问责与考核,程序和法理的约束相对较少。这三个方面相互耦合,相互支持,构成一个内在一致的治理体系。行政发包制作为一种分析概念不仅被用于分析中国政府间关系的主要特征及其演变过程,而且还与政治锦标赛相结合,在纵向与横向两个维度上深入探讨中国政府治理的内在机制。

总之,本书在广泛吸收现存文献的基础上,试图大力推进目前关于官员激励与政府治理的理论分析,揭示中国传统政府治理的独特模式及其演变逻辑,将官员激励、政府治理与中国经济增长与运行特征联系起来,建立中国特色的政治经济学基础,强调中国故事对于当前制度经济学和政治经济学研究的重要启示。[^15]

## 1.4 研究问题与主要内容

下面我们对本书的基本内容做一个扼要的介绍。需要强调的是,我们整个研究实际上是围绕着一系列重大理论和政策问题展开的,希望读者能够带着这些问题去阅读本书。

我们要回答的第一组相关的问题是,当中国政府体制以政治集权为特征,那为什么地方政府还能在中国高速经济增长中发挥极为重要的促进作用?中国如何利用其独特的政府体制和区域经济特征设计地方官员的激励机制,从而获得了其他发展中国家和转型国家难以看到的激励效果和增长绩效?中国改革前后见证了经济体制的巨大改革与变化,但是从外部特征看中国的政治和行政体制并没有发生大的变化,为什么一个看似相同的政治和行政体制却可以支撑中国30多年的高速经济增长?中国的政府体制与市场化、经济发展究竟存在怎样的内在关联?

第二组问题涉及中国政府间关系的基本特征。我们可以发现,中国一方面是高度集权的国家,行政权、立法权和人事权高度集中于中央,与此同时又是高度分权的国家,几乎任何事权都分散在各级地方政府手里。为什么中国的政府治理会呈现出高度集权和高度分权相统一的特征?而且,为什么中国各级政府体现为重叠式结构(即所谓的“职责同构”)而不是类似于西方国家普遍的分工协作方式?为什么中国政府间关系、行政机关与事业单位之间、政府与企业之间经常喜欢采用“财政承包制”或“预算包干制”?为什么我们经常看到“一包就灵”的说法?

第三组问题是始于这样一个基本观察:在毛泽东时代,只要经济形势允许就极力推动地方分权的改革,但经常酿成国民经济失控的乱局;到了邓小平时代,地方分权仍然是改革的主线,却为中国高速增长奠定了重要的制度基础。为什么毛泽东和邓小平都不约而同地采取相似的地方分权战略?同样是地方分权,为什么结局却截然不同?

更进一步的问题是,50年代“大跃进”时期,毛泽东鼓励地方政府之间的经济竞争,地方官员之间也围绕着钢铁和粮食产量竞相“放卫星”。这和改革开放以来地方官员围绕着经济绩效(如GDP和财税增长、招商引资)的官场竞争有着相似之处。同样是围绕着经济指标的官场竞争(政治锦标赛),两者带来的经济后果却天壤之别,前者是经济混乱,后者是经济奇迹,如何理解这两个时期政治锦标赛的根本性差异?

第四组问题是,如何理解中国的政府与市场的关系?地方政府在区域经济发展过程中扮演怎样的治理角色?中国的市场经济与东亚国家、西方发达国家、发展中国家相比有何独特之处?在国际学术界,有学者用“日本股份公司”或“韩国股份公司”的概念去刻画日本、韩国政府在经济起飞过程中的独特治理角色。当然,中国在一定程度上与日韩所代表的东亚模式相似,比如一直有国家层面的五年计划/规划和产业政策,它们在经济发展过程中发挥了重要的指导作用。随着改革开放的不断深入,中国的市场化、经济一体化和参与全球化的进程不断加快,非国有部门在中国经济中占据了重要地位。这使得中国的市场经济具备西方发达国家的许多特征。然而,与所有这些国家不同的是,中国企业的市场竞争背后是不同辖区地方官员之间的竞争,官场竞争与市场竞争相互交织,相互作用,呈现出政府与市场之间复杂微妙的“纠缠”关系。借用“日本股份公司”的比喻,中国的政府与市场的关系特征是数量众多的“地方股份公司”之间的高度竞争。如何理解中国“官场+市场”关系格局的性质、特征和影响? 官场与市场有何不同的竞争逻辑?这种地方官员与企业家的双层竞争格局对中国经济增长产生了哪些重要影响?

第五组问题涉及国家治理能力问题。一方面,当我们将中国与国外做对比的时候,经常用“举国体制”“集中力量办大事”来强调中国行政权力集中的制度优势。我们确实在经济发展、航天工程、高铁、国防工业、救灾等方面体现了资源动员的独特效率和优势。然而,中国的政府治理在有些方面,如食品安全、教育医疗、环境治理,却一直乏善可陈。如何理解中国的国家治理能力?为什么中国的国家治理会呈现这些悖论性现象?

最后一组基本问题是中国的地方政府治理将如何转型?近年来中国政府愈来愈强调行政问责、亲民和阳光政府,强调政府职能的转变,比如从建设性财政向公共财政转变、行政审批制度的改革、政府机构精简等。从90年代中期开始,中国开始进入了一个所谓“垂直化管理浪潮”,即银行、国税、海关变成中央垂直管理,质检、国土、工商变成省内垂直管理。另一方面,媒体、互联网的监督作用日益上升,人大和政协的作用不断提高。我们如何理解这些变化的意义和进一步改革的方向?尤其是,我们怎么理解这些变化对中国增长模式转变的影响?

本书试图对上述问题做出分析与解答,并提供回答这些问题所需的概念工具和理论框架。我们将以行政发包制、政治锦标赛、“官场+市场”这些分析概念与框架为中心揭示中国官员激励与政府治理的运作机制、特征与内在逻辑,政府与市场关系的独特性质以及与中国经济转型与发展之间的深刻联系。

后面各章的基本内容概述如下。第2章研究我国政府间关系的一个基本特征,即属地化的行政发包制。我们首先对于我国政府间关系的研究文献做了一个简单的综述。虽然国内外学者已经揭示出中国政府间关系的许多特征,如“蜂窝式结构”“M型结构”“职责同构”“压力型体制”等等,但是迄今为止,所有这些特征似乎都是毫不关联的平行罗列。我们在本章所提出的行政发包制的分析概念可以把这些看似不相关的特征统一起来,变成内在一致的系统性特征,并揭示背后的治理逻辑。我们从行政权分配、经济激励和内部考核三个维度定义了行政发包制区别于韦伯意义上的官僚制(科层制)。行政发包制作为一种治理制度可以追溯到中国的古代,尤其是明清和民国时期。新中国成立以后,高度集权的计划经济体制虽然在许多方面修正了古代的属地化行政发包制,但仍然承袭和发展了传统的因素。80年代的改革开放在一定意义上是更彻底地回到传统的属地化行政发包体制,赋予地方政府较为充分的行政权和财政权。最后我们对90年代中期以来行政发包体制所遇到的冲击和改革进行了描述和分析。本章还讨论了决定行政发包程度与范围的决定因素,主要是委托人的信息和监督成本、财政约束和统治风险。最后我们将行政发包制与行政分权、M型组织、西方公共管理运动的政府外包等组织形态进行了比较,为确立行政发包制作为一种分析的理想类型的价值和意义。

第3章和第4章分别对新中国成立以来政府间关系的两个基本方面——地方分权和财政分成进行了历史描述和理论分析,这有助于深化我们对于属地化行政发包制的演变逻辑及其影响的理解。第3章首先回顾了改革前中央和地方的权力关系,从这些历史描述中我们不难发现,在所谓的高度集权的计划经济时期,中国经历了多次地方分权的尝试,这些努力造就了中国式的计划经济与M型结构,与苏联中央集权的U型结构形成鲜明对比。改革开放之后,中央更彻底地推行了地方分权改革,并且采取“以点带面”的地区倾斜式的分权策略。我们分析了为什么改革开放前三十年与后三十年中央同样热衷于地方分权,但两者结局却大不相同的原因。第3章还探讨了政府间条块关系的演变和最近所发生的一系列值得注意的变化,利用行政发包制的概念对条块关系和项目制的治理特征进行了分析。最后特别聚焦于县乡间政府关系,这是行政逐级发包的末端,有一些值得注意的特征。

第4章对中国转型中政府间的财政分成进行了研究。本章首先回顾了改革前中央和地方财政关系的演变。这些演变经历了多次“集权—分权”的循环,但随着每一次权力下放,地方的财力和财权都在逐渐增加。令人多少有些吃惊的是,在计划经济体制下中央和地方的财政关系其实经常引入“包干制”的因素,与“统收统支”的传统描述相左。我们对传统财政体制中的激励与承诺问题进行了一些理论分析,由此解释改革前中央和地方财政关系演变的特征。然后我们讨论了财政包干制、分税制改革的成因、内容和影响,尤其强调这些财政分成改革与改革前财政体制之间内在的联系,以及在何种意义上代表了一种制度进步和突破。然后对最近新一轮的财税体制改革进行了简要的分析。我们还分析了预算外财政在中国财政体制中的作用和长期存在的原因,强调中国财政体制的“激励型”特征。

第5章讨论了中国政府治理的一个极为重要的激励机制——政治锦标赛模式。过去的主流文献主要强调行政和财政分权对于促进地方政府推动地方经济发展的作用,我们则强调地方官员之间的晋升竞争及其激励效应。本章首先阐述了中国逐级淘汰的政治锦标赛的主要特征、有效实施的前提和条件,以及中国为什么特别适合采用政治锦标赛这种激励方式。然后具体分析以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛如何激励地方官员及其局限性。中国特色的产权保护和投资鼓励不是主要通过西方意义上的司法体系,而是通过地方官员出于自身的政治利益而提供的政策保证。当然晋升激励只对那些存有晋升机会的代理人才能产生激励,而对于那些因为各种原因(如年龄)失去晋升希望的人,政治锦标赛难以发挥作用。我们分析了中国基层政府的晋升之难的现状和影响。关于改革开放以来中国干部人事制度的调整与改革的历史过程也做了较为详细的描述,旨在为我们理解当前的政治锦标赛的形成奠定一个历史背景。我们还对中国干部人事制度中的一个重要现象——干部异地交流制度的成因和效果进行了理论分析,指出它与政治锦标赛之间的内在联系。最后一节我们提出中国政经互动的独特模式,即“官场+市场”模式,它由GDP挂帅的政治锦标赛直接引申而来,地方官员之间的官场竞争与辖区企业之间的市场竞争高度结合,相互影响,塑造了中国特色的政府与市场关系,奠定了中国经济增长独有的制度基础。

第6章至第8章是“官场+市场”模式所带来一系列政经互动现象与问题的分析。基于笔者的一些相关研究,第6章分析了官员特征和官场竞争对区域经济发展的影响。首先是对中央和地方关系中的“层层加码”现象的系统描述和解析。不管是五年规划还是年度经济计划,关于GDP增长目标从中央到省、市、县是一个逐级加码的过程,而且每级地方政府的实际完成的增长率总体上还超额完成其增长目标。“层层加码”的背后是各级地方官员的晋升竞争。我们接着研究市级主政官GDP增长的前一年省内排名对当年GDP增长的影响,这是从动态政治锦标赛的角度理解地方官员激励极其影响的尝试。我们还分析了由地方官员晋升激励所引发的政治商业周期现象,如地方官员任期与辖区投资增长的关系,党代会周期与地区制造业的资源错配程度的关系。本章还探讨了地级市领导的年龄与城商行的信贷数量和质量之间的关系。最后一节讨论了地方政府的土地财政和经营城市问题。土地财政是分税制改革之后地方政府最重要的财政手段之一,我们分析了土地财政与城市化、工业化与区域经济竞争之间的内在关联。地方政府从过去以“经营企业”为主逐渐过渡为“经营城市”为主,而这一切的背后都是地方政府在不同的改革发展阶段牢牢抓住经济发展主导权的动机。地方政府为何能够在市场化进程中一直保持地区经济轴心地位?本章给了一些初步的分析。

第7章研究地方官员的晋升激励对区域经济竞争与合作的影响。我们首先列举了许多实例说明区域经济互动中长期存在的地方保护主义、重复建设和恶性竞争问题,并指出这些问题的存在无法单纯用地方政府的财税动机来解释。我们还描述了一个相关联的区域经济发展现象,即行政区交界地带的经济落后问题。然后我们提出一个统一的分析框架对这些区域经济互动现象进行了系统的解释,认为地方官员之间对于“双赢”合作动机不足主要源于晋升博弈的零和博弈性质和晋升竞争的官员之间利益补偿的困难。最后我们同样在晋升博弈的框架下讨论为什么会出现“报团竞争”的现象。

政企关系构成地方经济治理的一个核心方面,而改革开放过程见证了中国政企关系的根本性变化。第8章研究的内容从“官场+市场”的视角解析过去30多年地方官员与国有企业和民营企业的关系性质及其演变。我们首先考察了地方政府与国有企业关系的性质及其演变,尤其注重从政府和企业的行政与经济事务发包的角度看待国有企业改革的方式和历程。地方政府在乡镇企业的异军突起中扮演了关键性作用,而这种作用与中央对乡镇企业的矛盾态度形成鲜明对比。随着绝大多数国有企业的改制,地方政府与企业的关系发生了根本性的变化。地方政府和非国有企业形成“战略合作伙伴”关系不再基于所有权和控制权关系,而是政治锦标赛和财政分成制度下形成的晋升激励和财税激励,政企关系、政商关系被深深打上了“官场+市场”运作的烙印。最后,我们对中国地区间政商环境的系统差异提出了一个简单的理论假说,并列举了一系列与这个假说相一致的观察和证据。

第9章综合前面提出的行政发包制和政治锦标赛两个核心概念,提出了一个分析我国官员激励和政府治理的理论框架,试图揭示中国独特的政府治理所蕴涵的灵活性、动员能力和潜在的问题。行政发包制与政治锦标赛构成了相互联系和相互支持的一个整体,体现了纵向发包和横向竞争的高度统一。从这个分析框架出发,我们解释了中国行政治理的“集权—分权”悖论,说明了中国行政体制高度集权和高度分权相统一的制度基础;并对中国政府间盛行的“责任状”和“数目字管理”的现象进行了剖析。我们将中国行政治理的特征及其演变与中国经济增长之谜联系起来,认为改革开放以来地方分权、财政分成和晋升竞争这三方面的改革激活了中国传统行政治理的积极因素,它们之间相互支持、相互强化而构成一个内在一致的地方政府治理的新系统,为地方官员推动经济增长的强激励提供了关键性的制度基础。当然,传统地方政府治理也内嵌了一些难以克服的弱点,如地方政府的软预算约束问题、官员腐败问题以及地方保护主义问题。本章最后结合政治锦标赛和行政发包制剖析了中国国家治理能力的强项与弱项,发现国家能力强弱分布的领域与政治锦标赛、行政发包制之间组合的特征密不可分。

第10章对于中国政府治理的改革与转型提出了我们的一些看法。首先我们总结了中国政府治理面临的一系列问题和挑战,这些问题均都可以追溯到政府的缺位和错位,最终与行政发包制和政治锦标赛有着深刻的联系。行政发包制与政治锦标赛所打造的中国特有的官员激励和政府治理模式既是中国高速经济增长的制度源泉,同时又是当前经济面临的各种重大问题的主要根源。而这一切的形成来源于我们政府体制中的信息与监督的性质(自上而下的监督和制约),要改变这一切必须改革中央关于地方政府施政的信息获取和监督的方式,因此地方政府改革面临一个系统性的变化,即中国传统行政体制的转型。我们概述了过去20年中国政府治理在行政发包制和政治锦标赛两个维度上所经历的重大转型,如条块管理中的“垂直化收权运动”、公共财政的建设、收支两条线改革和国库的集中收付制度、淡化GDP挂帅、差额选举、民众满意度调查等等,这些看似相对独立的改革,从我们本书所建立的分析框架看,其实是相互支持、相互推动的系统变化,预示了中国传统行政治理——属地化行政发包制和政治锦标赛——的系统改革和向现代性政府治理的转型。如果我们把中国行政体制的这些变化与西方国家近年来所推行的“新公共管理”运动进行比较,就会发现当西方国家试图从传统的韦伯式的官僚制向以市场、分权为导向的契约制过渡,而中国却在从高度分权化和市场化的行政发包制向韦伯式官僚制过渡,即越来越强调规则、程序和可问责性,传统行政治理的“强激励”性质在不断减弱。如何在强激励导向与规则和程序导向之间寻求一个合适的权衡将是未来地方政府治理转型的一个重要研究课题。

# 2 行政发包制

绝大多数国家的政府是一个从中央到地方的多层级结构。我们要了解某一级地方政府的运行特征和深层逻辑,必须把它置于这个多层级的结构中,研究它与其他层级政府间的关系。把握政府间关系的基本特征对于我们理解地方官员的激励、行为和影响来说是至关重要的。这一章我们试图揭示出中国政府间关系长期以来所呈现的基本特征以及深层的制度逻辑。我们认为,中国政府间关系呈现出的一系列特征,主要体现为多层级权力关系下以属地管理为基础的行政逐级发包制,或者说是政府内部的发包制,简称为“行政发包制”。行政发包制作为一种理想类型,既区别于韦伯意义上的官僚科层制,也区别于纯粹的外包制(即政府通过契约方式向非政府组织(如企业)发包政府事务),属于一种居于两者之间的混合形态。[^1] 行政发包制并非新中国所独创,它的基本原型至少可以追溯到明清时期的政府间关系,甚至是秦汉时期中国官僚体制的形成阶段,而新中国成立之后进行了重要的发展和改造。改革开放以来,行政发包制作为中国政府治理的独特模式历经一系列改革和创新的过程,经济一体化、全球化以及信息技术和互联网的迅猛发展更是使之处于前所未有的变革关口。然而,制度的路径依赖在行政发包制上也得以充分体现,它的一些核心特征在历史演变的长河中一直保持顽强的生命力和延续性,对中国的行政、经济和社会各方面产生了广泛和深刻的影响。

## 2.1 中国政府间关系的特征：文献回顾

国内外学者关于中国政府间关系的研究文献不胜枚举。关于中国处于计划经济体制下政府间关系,尤其是中央和地方的关系,有两个相互关联的理论概括。第一个很有影响的理论是许惠文(Vivienne Shue,1988)提出的。她认为,中国的基层政府组织像是一个蜂窝式(cellular)的结构,每个乡村都是一个“小而全”、相对自给自足的单元,各个乡村之间联系很少,而主要在垂直方向与上级政府发生联系;虽然国家的建制直接渗透到乡镇一级,但乡镇和村干部并不是简单的服从上级指示的国家代理人,而是极力维护和伸张地方利益,变通执行甚至抵制对当地不利的国家政策。乡村社会对于国家行政力量的抵制和制衡与中国历史上长期存在的乡绅自治的传统有着密切的关系。许惠文的理论在学术界之所以富有影响,主要在于她突破了绝大多数西方政治学家的传统主流观点,这些主流观点从极权主义模型出发认为中国的国家对社会和基层政府组织的渗透和垂直控制是全面而深入的,地方政府被理解为国家政策和利益的直接代理人和被动的接受者。许惠文强调了在一个看似中央高度集权的体制下,中国呈现出明显的相对独立的“地方主义”倾向。第二个有影响的理论概括是钱颖一和许成钢提出了关于计划体制下中国经济的“M型结构”假说(Qian and Xu, 1993)。他们认为,苏联的计划经济接近于一个U型结构,中央和地方(共和国)的关系体现为一种是垂直的、纵向的计划管理关系,而各个共和国之间的经济联系根据专业化分工的原则加以组织,服从中央计划委员会的专业部委的垂直管理和协调。而在改革前的中国,计划经济采用的是一种M型结构,即一个结构和功能类似的多层次和多地区的管理结构,又称“块块经济”,各个省区之间经济上相对独立,每一个省区都试图建立相对完备和独立的工业体系,变成一个相对自给自足的经济单元。U型结构在利用规模经济、实行专业化方面相对于M型结构有着优势,这是苏联工业一度高度发达的原因之一。但是U型结构的缺点在于难以应对复杂的经济环境。而相比之下,M型结构在信息处理上的低成本、应对外界反应的灵活性,以及在进行制度试验方面的可控性等优势就凸显出来。“M型结构”假说以非常简明和清晰的方式刻画了中国传统经济结构的基本特征,说明中国即使在高度集中的计划经济体制下也维持了地方经济的相对独立性,在高度集权的行政体制下保留了相当程度的地方分权。

改革之后,中国政府间关系在传统的蜂窝式结构和M型结构的基础上进一步加强了地方分权的力度和广度。以钱颖一、温加斯特为代表的经济学家提出了著名的“中国特色的财政联邦主义”理论(Qian and Weingast,1997)。该理论认为,改革开放以来中央向地方政府的行政性分权和以财政包干制为特征的财政分权是中国高速经济增长的制度基础。经济管理权限和财权的下放促进了地区之间的要素竞争,而竞争导致了地方政府对于国有企业预算约束的硬化。

关于中国政府间关系的描述,除了地方分权之外,还有一些其他值得注意的特征。容敬本等(1998)提出,在中国行政性分权体制下,90年代以来县乡结构日益呈现为一种“压力型体制”。所谓“压力型体制”,是指一级政治组织(县、乡)为了实现经济赶超,完成上级下达的各项指标而采取的数量化任务分解的管理方式和物质化的评价体系。为了完成经济赶超任务,各级政府组织(以党委和政府为核心)向下级组织和个人层层分解任务指标,责令其在规定时间内完成,并配之以相应的行政和经济方面的奖惩措施。这种层层压指标、定任务的方式如同政治承包制,各级组织也就是在这种评价体系的压力下运行。压力型体制虽然催生了官员企业家的出现和经济的快速发展,但也带来了许多问题,比如在分税制造成的地方财政压力下,县级政府倾向于把财政责任和负担向下推卸,而把财力从下而上加以集中,导致乡镇财政负担加重,引发农村“乱收费、乱罚款、乱摊派”现象越演越烈,屡禁不止。朱光磊、张志红(2005)揭示了中国政府间的“职责同构”现象,即在政府间关系中,从中央到地方各级政府,不同层级的政府在纵向上职能、职责和机构设置上高度统一和高度同构。每一级政府管理大体相同的事情,在政府机构设置上也相应表现为“上下对口,左右对齐”。与和西方发达国家政府间分工合作关系有很大的不同,中国的中央和地方关系体现为事权分配职责模糊、上下错位、机构从上到下重叠等问题。

基于中国人事权高度集中的事实,周黎安(2004,2007)提出了政治锦标赛理论,从晋升竞争的角度理解中国地方官员的政治激励的性质及其影响。周黎安(2008)结合政治锦标赛理论,引入了“行政发包制”的新概念,使用纵向行政发包和横向晋升竞争两个维度概括中国政府间关系和治理的基本特征,以此分析中国的“集权—分权”悖论及其他重要的政府治理现象。Landry(2008)和Xu(2011)均强调,中国政府间关系体现为政治集权与经济分权相结合的治理体制。周雪光(2011)从矛盾—应对的角度提出,中国政府间关系和治理的许多现象内生于中央统辖权与地方治理权之间的矛盾及其对矛盾的应对机制。曹正汉(2011)从统治风险的控制角度分析了中国长期以来“上下分治”的治理体制。

上述理论文献虽然从不同的角度揭示了中国政府间关系和政府治理的某些重要特征,但都有各自的问题和局限。比如“中国特色的财政联邦主义”理论假说,与中国的现实存有较大的差距,主要体现在两个方面:第一,在中国,中央政府拥有无上的权威以及任意干预权,这与强调基于制度分权的联邦制的安排难以兼容;第二,联邦制对统一国内市场的要求(如美国的联邦制)以及联邦法律高于州法律的要求也显然与中国的现实不符。长期以来中国盛行各种地方保护主义(市场、司法等方面),使得国内消费者和企业饱受地区行政割据之苦。中国《立法法》将国家部委制定的法律条例与省级政府制定的法律条例置于相同的法律地位,也与美国联邦制呈现巨大反差。荣敬本等(1998)提出的“压力性体制”理论虽然在一定程度上解释了在政治承包制下基层政府的运行特征和生存现状,然而,只注意到在政府间责任状之下乡镇政府如何被迫接受上级的高压指标是片面的,因为基层或下级官员从晋升竞争的角度也可能会主动提出指标加码,“层层加码”现象也可能是下级政府在晋升竞争中自愿加码的结果(周黎安等,2015;Li et al.,2012)。另外,荣敬本等(1998)主要探讨了县乡两级政府间的关系特征,对于中国整个政府间关系该理论的推广性究竟如何仍然不清楚。Landry(2008)和Xu(2011)概括了中国集权与分权并存的重要特征,但没有解释这种制度特征背后的驱动因素,因而无法揭示中国政府治理及其演变背后的逻辑和机理。周黎安(2008)提出的行政发包制强调其构成要素之间的互补性和治理形态的系统性,试图将政府治理的研究朝着分析性和构建性的方向推进,同时结合政治锦标赛理论,从纵向发包和横向竞争两个维度解释中国政府治理的现象、特征及其演变。但是行政发包制在概念上仍有许多不清晰之处,比如它如何区别于其他有关组织的理想类型(如科层制、外包制、M型结构、联邦制等),尤为关键的问题是行政发包的程度由何种因素决定也不清楚,分析概念上的模糊限制了该理论进一步发展的空间。

本章试图系统论证行政发包制如何成为分析政府间关系、官员激励和政府治理的一种理想类型,其独特的内涵、价值和意义何在。我们将看到,“行政发包制”既区别于韦伯意义上的科层制,又区别于纯粹的外包制,与文献里用来描述多层级公司或政治组织的M型结构、联邦制也风格迥异。已有文献所涉及的关于中国政府间关系的不同特征,如“蜂窝式结构”、“M型结构”、“压力型体制”、基层政府的政治承包制、政府间“职责同构”现象以及面向地区分权的权威主义体制,看似是相互独立、互不相关的一组现象。然而,如果从行政发包制这个新框架出发,我们就会发现这些不同文献所揭示的不同侧面和现象其实是内在一致、相互关联的有机统一体,都是行政发包制更深层特征的折射和反映。

## 2.2 行政发包制：定义与特征

“行政发包制”概念与经济学的企业理论有着密切的关联。经济学的企业理论区分了企业治理的两个基准模式:发包制(subcontracting)与雇佣制(employment relations),前者对应着两个企业之间的市场交易关系,后者对应着企业内部的行政命令关系。在组织形式上,企业如果是“自己生产”,则是对应着“雇佣制”,即企业主提供生产性资产,雇佣工人,进行生产;而“外部购买”对应着“发包制”,意味着承包企业负责组织生产,提供生产工具和雇佣工人。雇佣制也可以看做是韦伯意义上的科层制或官僚制。企业究竟是在企业内部生产,还是把一部分生产环节外包给市场上独立的组织,涉及企业组织最优边界的决定问题,这是自科斯以来经济学企业理论讨论的核心问题(Coase,1937;Williamson,1975,1985;Grossman and Hart,1986;Hart and Moore,1990)。

在关于企业边界的各种理论中,Holmstrom和Milgrom(1994)提出的“企业作为一种激励系统”的观点独具特色。他们从资产的所有权(asset ownership)、激励契约(incentive contract)和任务分配(task assignment)三个角度对发包制和雇佣制进行了更系统的区分。[^2] 在发包制下,承包方拥有资产所有权,给定发包企业支付的价格,承包方所耗费的成本越低,净收益越高,所以承包方面临高强度的激励契约(即报酬与企业绩效高度相关);作为委托人的发包方只是支付给代理人(承包方)一定的价格,购买其产品或服务;产品如何生产完全由承包企业决定,后者自由裁量权非常大。雇佣制的特征是委托人拥有生产性资产的所有权,向雇员(代理人)发布指令进行生产,雇员的自由裁量权比较少;鉴于雇员在企业内部要完成多任务,为了不诱使雇员厚此薄彼,雇佣制设计了一种弱激励的薪酬体系(即薪酬与企业绩效的相关性较弱)。[^3]

经济学关于企业发包制与雇佣制的区分很有启发意义,但其分析框架无法简单复制到我们关心的行政组织和政府治理的领域。这里主要存在三个问题: 首先,在行政组织领域,交易费用理论和产权理论均强调的资产专用性在大多数场合不是一个关键性因素(Moe,1990)。其次,企业的利润最大化假设无法简单复制到行政组织。最后,虽然政府的边界问题如同企业的边界问题一样重要,但是政府组织边界内的治理结构(如行政权分配,预算与内部控制)对于我们理解政府组织的性质和特征极为重要,而上述企业理论完全没有涉及。

周黎安(2008,2014,2016)借鉴企业理论中关于发包制与雇佣制的观点,提出并完善了“行政发包制”的概念。目前经济学和社会学文献主要研究纯粹的“科层制”和“外包制”,而“行政发包制”作为一种理想类型属于一种混合的中间形态,即在行政组织边界之内的“内部发包制”:在一个统一的权威之下,在上级与下级之间嵌入了发包的关系。这如同农村集体土地制度下的“分田到户”:土地从所有权来看仍然属于集体所有制,村集体拥有对土地的控制权(如土地分配权),但是“分田到户”相当于在集体所有的框架下植入了发包的内容,农民享有相对独立的生产决策权和收益权。[^4]

为了描述行政发包制的特征,我们将行政发包制与典型的科层制和外包制做一个对比。这里我们借鉴Holmstrom和Milgrom(1994)的思路,同时注意到行政组织与企业组织之间的重要区别,提出区分行政发包制、科层制与纯粹外包制的三个维度。这三个维度分别是行政权的分配、经济激励及内部考核和控制。行政发包制与纯粹的科层制和外包制在这三个维度上存在系统的差异。

首先,在行政权的分配上,行政发包制呈现以下两个基本特点:第一,委托人(发包方)拥有正式权威(如人事控制权、监察权、指导权、审批权)和剩余控制权(如不受约束的否决权和干预权)。这反映了行政组织内部上下级之间的权力分配,而非纯粹外包制下发包方和承包方平等的契约关系。[^5] 第二,具体的执行权(即通常所说的事权)交给了承包方,更重要的是,承包方还以自由裁量权的方式享有许多实际控制权,即所谓的“天高皇帝远”的情形。

其次,在经济激励方面(即财政预算和人员激励),行政发包制与科层制存在鲜明的区别,总体上表现为承包方拥有“剩余索取权”[^6] 和面临强激励[^7] 的特征,即承包方所能控制的财政预算和人员的薪酬福利均与行政府服务的数量和人员努力的程度高度相关,承包方面临自筹资金的压力。在预算权分配上行政发包制有以下两个基本特征: 第一,承包方与发包方处于财政或预算分成关系,承包方拥有剩余索取权,通俗地说就是“交够上级的,剩下就是自己的”。在现实生活中最常见的情况是,处于承包地位的下级政府或行政部门需要向上级上交一个定额或固定比例的预算收入,或者上级单位设定一个补助额(或拨款额),政府单位实行财政或预算包干制;如果上级补助拨款或预算不足,下级承包方则需自筹解决,自负盈亏。[^8] 第二,承包方的预算支出能力高度依赖于其筹集财政收入或收费的能力,即所谓的“收支一条线”。行政发包制在承包方的人员薪酬决定和激励体系上比较接近市场化的安排,薪酬和福利(包括奖金、晋升甚至灰色收入)与创造的收入或服务高度挂钩,是一种收入分成的强激励形式,而非采取固定的薪酬和福利方式。

行政发包制之下的财政(预算)包干制意味着承包方的支出责任与财权、财力是脱节的。发包方基于上下级权力关系,以行政事务包干的方式要求承包方承担所有相关的支出责任,而与此同时未必安排了与这些支出责任相对应的财权和财力。承包人必须自寻财路,弥补两者之间的缺口。发包人和承包人有一个隐含的契约或约定,承包方自寻财路的做法只要在一定限度内都是被允许的,也就是说,承包方拥有某种事实上、非正式的“财权”,如征收附加税或额外收费。

第三,相比强调程序和规则的科层制,行政发包制的内部控制是一种结果导向的、人格化的责任分担。中国长期沿用的“属地管理”所强调的就是“谁主管,谁负责”,即辖区内发生的所有事情,不管是否与辖区内部的管理有关,都属于辖区行政首脑的责任。上级下达的任务指标,往往以结果论英雄,不管下级是否有能力和条件完成,或者执行过程是否严格合乎程序和规则。有不少公共事物属于跨区域性质(如剿匪、污染治理、物价控制、食品安全),或者具有跨区域的溢出性(如教育收益),按照“属地发包管理”的逻辑,这些事情也是地方政府的责任。这种结果导向和人格化的问责便于减少中央的责任和管理负担,对于承包方来说则是责任明晰和考核压力大的一种制度安排,但在属地之间联系紧密、承包方自主程度不高的情况下容易导致责任、权力和能力的脱节。由于在行政发包下承包方具体执行发包方交办的事务,拥有许多自由裁量权,同时也控制了相关信息的向上披露,所以上级经常也只能依赖最终的结果进行考核和控制。

关于行政发包制上述三个特征,尤其是第一个特征,容易引起误解和争论[^9] ,原因在于行政发包制是一种混合形态,兼具理性科层制和纯粹外包制两者的一些重要特征,但又区别于两者;它同时包含了决策权、预算薪酬和问责方式三个维度的特征,这些特征还是一个内在一致、相互支持的有机体。目前文献中关于中国政府治理特征的描述,如M型结构、地区分权的权威体制、财政联邦主义等,均只涉及其中一个(如决策权)或两个维度(决策权和财政权)。所以我们需要做进一步的解释。

关于在行政发包制下委托人和承包方的权力分配关系,我们以当今中国的政府间关系为例加以说明。所谓委托人所拥有的正式权威如“指导权”“监督权”和“干预权”以及承包方拥有的具体实施权,就是对应着下述情况:中央关于某些战略目标给出一些纲领性的指导意见,具体实施方案交由地方政府决定;由于中央给出的指导意见往往只是一些大的路线方针(即“指导权”),地方政府在决定实施细则时面临较大的决策空间[^10] ;中央对于地方具体实施的效果也经常会进行事后检查验收(即行驶“监督权”),如果发现地方在执行政策时出现重大偏差也可能会进行必要的干预。如果考虑到多个层级间的政府关系,那么“指导权”和“执行权”就是相对的,上一级对下一级的工作具有指导权,而下一级总是具有执行上一级指示的相当的自由裁量空间(即执行权和相应的决策权)。比如政府的“五年计划”,从中央到省、市、县都会提出各自版本,而上一级政府的五年计划就是下一级政府五年计划的指导意见,下一级的五年计划相当于是上一级五年计划的具体实施细则。[^11]

这里定义的发包方与承包方的行政权分配在现实当中的对应最接近于我国政府间的“块块”关系,如果将此概念延伸至政府间“条块”关系、“条条”关系或者“条—块—条”关系,发包方的行政权力的内涵要发生相应的变化。比如上级环保部门将一些环境整治任务(如治理雾霾)发包给下级地方政府,并定期考核环保任务的完成情况。在这种情况下,发包方就没有对于承包方的人事任免权,但拥有监察和指导权,甚至可以找地方领导人约谈或通报批评。当然,发包方拥有的行政权力大小和组合直接影响行政发包制的治理特征和结果。

为了更清楚地理解行政发包制的特征,我们不妨将它与严格意义上的官僚制或科层制进行比较。韦伯(2010)定义了现代官僚制的一系列特征,从我们的角度看,有如下五个特征值得强调:第一,官员有稳定的职业前景和晋升机会;第二,科层制内部存在上下级权力关系,职位的权限(管辖权)由法令清晰规定;第三,官员有可靠、合理的薪酬;第四,行政工具的集中化;第五,官员受到纪律和规则控制。第四个特征是指官员自己不提供行政所需的设备和费用,科层组织集中提供。韦伯认为官员的管理权与行政工具所有权的分离是现代官僚制的一个核心特征,据我所知,这个特征在现有的关于韦伯官僚制的研究中没有给予足够的重视,而行政发包制理论使我们重新认识它的重要性。

我们所定义的划分官僚制(科层制)与行政发包制的三个维度——行政权的分配,经济激励与内部控制,与韦伯对科层制特征的描述有着明显的对应关系。行政权的分配对应着韦伯科层制的第二个特征,行政发包制意味着在上下级的权威关系中,作为下级的承包人享有大量的自由裁量权(实际控制权),与官僚制下由法令严格控制的职权相对应。经济激励(即财政预算与人员激励)对应着韦伯科层制的第三和第四个特征,行政发包制意味着财政和预算包干制,承包人必须全部或局部自我筹资,以完成财政上缴和经费支出的任务,人员的报酬取决于提供服务的收费或收入分成,这和官僚制的全额财政预算及人员收入与业务活动无关的固定薪酬形成对照。内部控制对应着第五个特征,行政发包制意味着以结果为导向的考核与监控,纪律、规则和程序作用有限,而官僚制强调规则、程序和法理约束。

行政发包制的“行政性”内涵主要体现在以下三个方面:第一,发包人与承包人同处于一个权威体系,发包人具有支配性权力(所谓“权大一级压死人”),且双方处于“不完全契约”的关系,发包人有剩余控制权;这区别于正常情况下市场外包关系,双方处于自由平等的契约关系。第二,承包人具备晋升到上一级发包人的可能性,即具有“仕途前景”,如果存在多个相似的承包人,则承包人处于“官场竞争”关系。晋升序列是决定行政内包与外包边界的核心维度,虽然不是唯一维度(周黎安,2016)。第三,承包人面临一定的官僚规则约束和程序控制。而“发包”所刻画的是承包方所承担职责的范围和压力、自由裁量空间、筹集“预算外”收入的责任、参与分享收入的剩余索取权以及结果而非程序、规则导向的问责与考核。行政发包制当中“行政性”设置的重大意义体现在:委托人的正式权威和剩余控制权是用来控制重大决策,否决、制止和监督承包人的决策和行为。上级政府对下级政府定期和不定期的指导、巡视和监察,针对某项规定实施效果的检查等等,都是委托人的防范和纠偏行为。官僚规则和程序控制则是约束承包人的常规化制度设置。简言之,“行政性”的核心就是约束“发包制”在政府内部可能造成和放大的扭曲及伤害效应,就是试图通过一系列管控机制、激励机制(如晋升机制)和官僚规则,将承包人狭隘自利可能伤及委托人的行为限制在可以接受的范围。从这个意义上说,政府发包离开了行政性约束就像脱缰的野马一样不可收拾。在政府内部引入发包其实对行政性设置提出了更多的要求。当然,“行政性”设置越有效,承包人所享受的自由空间就越小,发包制的成分也就越少。在这种情况下,行政与发包是替代关系。[^12]

行政发包制的总体特征是正式组织内部的层层发包关系,类似于在企业内部引入市场交换关系,让原来受行政协调和控制的两个子公司之间的投入产出关系变成市场的竞争性交易关系。行政发包制不同于西欧中世纪的封建庄园制,后者不存在大领主与小领主之间的行政隶属和统摄关系,而是平等的契约关系和合作关系。在庄园制下,君主和分封的诸侯或庄园主属于一种非常松散的“市场交换”关系,君主分封“采邑”或“庄园”给诸侯和庄园主,换取后者的进贡、效忠和保护,在必要时封建诸侯必须为君主出兵打仗。封建庄园主和诸侯是非常独立的政治和经济组织,他们拥有自己独立的行政、土地、军队和司法,君王不干涉封建庄园和诸侯的任何内部事务。君王如同在市场上通过支付报酬(如采邑、封地)购买诸侯和庄园的行政和军事服务。中国周朝的分封制也不属于行政发包制,周王室与诸侯在权力关系上没有严格的统摄关系,诸侯拥有自己独立的行政、领土和司法。与西欧封建庄园制所不同的是,周朝的分封更多是基于宗法和血缘关系。

因此,行政发包制作为一种混合形态的组织类型,相当于在科层制内部引入了“分封”和“包干”的因素,或说在科层制的外壳之下植入了“发包制”的灵魂。

进一步看,行政发包制相比科层制来说其整合性和一体化协调的程度更弱,但因为承包方拥有较大的剩余索取权和自由裁量权,承包方激励强度较高;相比纯外包来说则其整合性和协调性则更强一些,毕竟委托人和代理人尚属于政府内部的上下级关系,在统一的权威框架之内,激励强度和自由度也相应地要弱一些。因此,行政发包制并不意味着完全没有一体化协调和整合性,它在这方面所呈现的特征,取决于我们要比较的基准。然而,正是因为行政发包制糅合了科层制和外包制的特征,它自身往往呈现出一系列看似矛盾的组织现象,比如发包方占有绝对的权威和剩余控制权(即相机干预权和否决权)与承包方拥有充分的执行权和自由裁量权共存,严格、繁复的官僚规则与大量的变通、潜规则和违规行为并立,正式与非正式制度高度结合。

正式制度中的非正式运作及其各种策略运用和变通实践在社会学中有大量的研究(王汉生等,1997;欧阳静,2011;周雪光,2013),这些文献均以韦伯的科层制为基准看待中国行政组织内的实际运行和策略运用如何有悖于科层理性的原则。从我的角度看,其实这些非正式运作和策略变通正是行政发包制下正式的权威关系和科层规则、承包方自由裁量权的积淀以及“结果导向”的考核逻辑三者之间互动的必然产物。对于严格科层制的一系列系统“偏离”也许纳入行政发包制的分析范畴更容易被解释,因为后者将这些非正式制度和变通实践作为“均衡”的常态现象而不是“偏离”来看待。行政发包制本身就包含了科层制的权威性、正式性与发包制的相机性、便利性和结果导向的共存与交织。[^13] 换句话说,用严格的科层制作为我们看待中国政府现象的基准也许过于理想了,而以行政发包制为观察基准可能提供了更贴近也更有价值的视角。

## 2.3 历史原型

行政发包制这个概念的提出对于刻画中国的政府间关系和政府治理的现实有何特殊的分析意义呢?虽然行政发包制作为一种理想类型无法与中国的现实建立严格和精确的对应,中国从古至今的行政体制和治理模式也非一成不变,但是,我们认为,行政发包制适合于中国政府间关系和政府治理一些长期稳定和显而易见的重要特征。说起中国的政府体制的特征,人们经常认为中国是现代文官制度和科层制的发源地,在历史上最早引入基于考试招聘政府官员的科举制,在西方国家还处于中世纪封建制度之时,中国早已是朝廷统一任免地方各级官员,早在隋唐就开始了科举取士。从这些事实看,使用科层制或官僚制来概括中国政府体制似乎更为合适。然而,我想强调的是,中国政府的科层制与现代韦伯意义上的科层制相比,更多是一个外在的特征和表象,在其核心运行的机制上,其实更接近于行政发包制的一些主要特征,即使今天也是如此。

为了理解行政发包制与中国从古到今的政府间关系治理的现实对应,首先让我们对中国古代的政府间关系的架构进行一番简要的描述。我们先从古代的行政管理体制开始,一是因为中国当今的行政体制承袭了古代行政体制的许多重要特征,具有强烈的“路径依赖”性质;二是古代政府的职责和职权、政府间关系相对单一,因而比较容易看清并概括其主要的特征。一旦解剖清楚古代行政体制的基本特征,再来反观现今的体制,就比较容易发现两者的联系和区别了。

中国自古以来的政府治理具有两个基本的特征:一是属地化管理,一是行政逐级发包。我们将看到,这两者之间有着密切的内在联系。

中国行政管理体制自古以来就是推行“属地化”分级管理模式,平民百姓所有的事情均服从其所隶属的行政管理层级的控制和管理。自商鞅变法以来,“五户一保,什户一甲”的户籍制度和“重农抑商”政策把农民牢牢的限制在土地上,束缚在“生于斯,死于斯”的地缘范围。政府一直把流民和游民作为对社会稳定的威胁而加以限制,因为流民和游民是“非属地”的,是对属地管理的一种冲击和威胁。[^14] 在县以下的乡村,由乡绅作为政府的代理人,负责乡村事务的管理,主要是征敛税赋。中国乡村长期以来流行的宗法宗族制,将血缘和地缘纽带的治理作用发挥到极致,进一步加强了属地化管理。宗族以族田和义庄为基础给其子弟提供资助、救济,设置学堂,传播诗书礼仪,与此同时又用严厉的族规家法制约族内子弟的行为。宗族变成一个县级以下基层准行政组织,有序管理个体和家族内部的各种事务。

属地化管理模式最重要的特征是:第一,平民百姓的日常事务(如户口登记、纳税、诉讼、灾荒救济)只和所在地的地方政府或行政组织发生联系,并由它直接管辖,与其他层级或区域的政府发生联系也一定要通过管辖政府这个中介。这个特征的一个直接后果就是信息的属地化,只有地方政府掌握辖区内百姓的相关信息。这可以解释为什么长期以来中国的信息收集和汇报一直是采取“层层上报”模式。第二,地域与地域之间横向联系较少,各自为政。属地之间自发自愿的横向联系也不被鼓励,每个地域属于一个相对自给自足和自我封闭的经济社会单元。属地化管理与经济一体化是内在矛盾的。第三,即使中央的机构派驻地方,其经费、后勤也主要由当地地方政府提供。

自秦汉以来中央和地方的行政关系一直体现出如下基本模式:朝廷无所不管,一切政令条例皆出自朝廷,但具体实施则全部由地方政府负责。一方面,一切权力来自中央。自隋唐以来,中央设置六部,分辖吏、户、礼、兵、刑、工,即官员任免和监察、财政、礼仪教化、军事、司法和营造六大方面,无所不包。但另一方面,在地方政府的建制中,唯有州县一级的行政长官属于“亲民官”,直接和百姓打交道,而在此之上的均属于“治官之官”(瞿同祖,2003,第29页)。虽然历经两千多年,自秦汉以来基层地方政府的职能和职权结构却一直非常稳定,历代县级长官的职能范围也大致一致,主要包括征敛赋税、维护地方治安、倡导教化、主持司法、兴修地方公共工程等。事实上,介于中央政府与基层政府之间的各色各样的督政机构,其设置和功能依不同朝代而变化,如秦汉的郡,隋唐的节度使,两宋的路,元代以来的省、道,但其职责主要是传递和贯彻中央的指令和监督基层官员,这一点倒是亘古不变。

历史上政府间的关系更像是组织内部的层层发包的关系。中央首先将行政和经济管理的具体事务全部发包给省一级政府,然后省政府再往下逐级发包,一直到县乡一级。上级行政指令和下级政府需要完成的职责可以看作是对发包内容的规定和要求。这些发包内容的规定和要求可以是显性和量化的,如每年上解的税赋,也可以是隐性和模糊的,如维持地方治安和礼仪教化。行政事务的逐级“转包”过程就是政府职责和职权的向下转移过程,中央以下每一级“承包方”必须向作为发包方的上级政府负责,而每一次发包方都有义务监督所有后续的承包方的职责。县(乡)作为最终的承包方,直接面对百姓大众,具体实施政府管理的各项事务,因此他们属于“父母官”或“亲民之官”,而介于中央和县乡之间的地方政府就是政府事务的中间“转包方”,主要履行控制和监督之责,属于“治官之官”。

识别行政发包制特征的关键,不能拘泥于政府治理的各种正式制度和名义规定,而应关注这些制度运行的常态化特征和隐性规则。在清代,一省之内的所有地方官员,从总督、巡抚到州县官员,均由吏部任命,属于朝廷命官。其次,地方政府的物质资产的所有者是皇帝,而不是地方政府。“普天之下,莫非王土;率土之滨,莫非王臣”,这非常形象和准确地说明了皇帝名义上拥有所有臣工的任免权和政府资产所有权的事实。但是在现实生活中,皇帝的绝对权力受制于信息不对称、交通和通信成本等因素,无论是任免权还是资产所有权实际上程度不同地被地方官员“劫持”。虽然地方官员的任命权在中央,吏部对省以下地方官员的人事任免最终做出正式决定,但省级官员可以就下属官员的晋升、降级、免职提出建议而施加重要影响。由于吏部不可能获得关于基层官员的许多具体信息,主要依靠省级官员提供,此时省级官员手上的“建议权”就变成了事实上的“任免权”。政府资产的产权问题也是类似的,皇帝名义上拥有一切政府资产,包括“官田”,但很显然,政府资产的实际使用权和支配权是在地方官员的手里。按照历史学家黄仁宇的说法,中国古代政府历来不善于用“数目字管理”,每年应交的田赋一直是一笔糊涂账,至于官田等政府资产的数额更是难以统计和掌控了。[^15] 归结起来,正因为古代的交通通信技术的落后,加上中国幅员辽阔,各地条件千差万别,中央的监控能力受到严重的限制,这使得名义上属于中央掌控的人事任命权和资产所有权不得不大打折扣,从而赋予了地方官员事实上的人事控制权和资产支配权。

关于清朝的州县官和基层政府的特征,冯友兰先生基于其父亲的亲身经历,提供了一段非常形象的描述:

“县官的收入,无论增加或减少,朝廷是不管的。实际上,朝廷是把这一块地方包给县官了,县官只要把每年规定的银子定额上缴国库,就算尽职了。县官实际上等于一个封君,他所管的一县就是他的‘采邑’。所不同于古代的封君者,就是古代的封君把采邑的收入全归自家享受,而县官则必须照定额向国库交银子。在这些地方,可以看出古代分封制的残余痕迹。县官确实像个百里侯。”(冯友兰,2008,第18页)

上述描述的要点是,州县官一方面是朝廷任免,处于帝国行政体制的最底层,看上去是科层制的鲜明特征,但是另一方面,州县官更像是一个封君和百里侯,用我们的术语则是朝廷行政事务和财政任务的承包方,地方政府的治理保留了“古代分封制的残余痕迹”。这在一定程度上印证了我们前面的观点:行政发包制的特征在于将发包制的灵魂植入科层制的外壳之内。瞿同组(2003)将清朝的基层地方政府描述为“一人政府”,州县官俨然成为朝廷基层事务的总承包方。

明清时期的财政制度从名义上说属于高度集权的管理模式。地方政府并不存在独立的财政预算,像当今所谓的“一级政府,一级财政”在古代是不存在的。在明代,地方政府征集的税赋分为“起运”和“留存”两部分,“起运”属于上解朝廷或税源地之外区域的部分,“留存”为保留在本地的余额,可用于地方官员的薪水、生员禀米、宗藩禄禀及地方性的开支(黄仁宇,2001)。最重要的一点是,“留存”并不属于地方政府可以自由支配的财政收入,理论上它是朝廷留存在地方、让地方官员托管的收入,如何开支均听命于朝廷。如果朝廷要求地方政府坐办,或修建船只,费用也是从留存中支付。在这个意义上,地方官员是朝廷在各地的财务总管,明清时期的政府间财政制度属于典型的“统收统支”。

然而,明清时期的财政实践体现出强烈的“财政包干”的色彩,与行政事务的发包制相呼应。长期以来,地方财政采取“双轨制”运行,以朝廷核定的正额为一轨,正额之外(各种杂税浮收)为另外一轨,近似于当今中国的预算内和预算外财政的并行。地方政府只需向朝廷上解相对固定的赋税,而剩下的税赋用于本级政府的行政支出和地方官员个人的收入,不足部分就全靠各种杂费和附加弥补,对于后者地方官员拥有几乎完全的自主权。

韦伯在描述中国古代赋税的“配额化”特点时指出:“官吏就像是封建领主或总督,负责向中央(下级官吏则向州省政府)上缴一定的租税额,而他自己则从实际征收来的租税和捐税中支付行政经费,并将余额保留给自己。”(韦伯,2003,第49页)比如在两汉,按规定田赋应该是按比例纳税,十五分之一或三十分之一,但随着时间推移,地方每年上缴的田赋就逐渐“定额化”了,不再以田亩的变化、粮食的丰歉为转移(郑学檬,2000)。在明清也是如此。基层政府向中央上解大致固定的税赋,剩下部分属于地方官员的薪俸和地方的一些行政费用,非常类似于“固定租金制”,即上交中央一个大致固定的税赋(相对于租金),剩余部分归地方政府使用。在很长的时间里,明代朝廷征收的税收定额大约在2700万石(黄仁宇,2001,第56页)。需要强调的一点是,正如古代皇室收入与国家收入的区分并非泾渭分明一样,地方官员的个人收入和政府收入也是模糊不清的。比如清代朝廷只给州县官非常微薄的薪俸,远不足以支付日常开支。不仅如此,州县官还需要用自己的薪俸支付雇佣幕僚等相关行政人员的费用。如果考虑到基层地方官员在上缴税赋时附加的“火耗”和各种杂费,那么地方官员就成为严格意义上的税收承包方了,交够国家的,剩下就是自己的。清代雍正时期“火耗归公”的改革就试图把各种税收附加予以合法化,先上缴省库,然后再下拨给地方官员,作为薪俸和其他行政费用的开支,以杜绝官吏的腐败,但这场改革最后以失败告终(曾小萍,2003)。

上述分析说明,对于中国的财政体制的理解,不论古代还是当代,如果我们只限于国家正式的财政体系而无视预算外财政的运行,只关注正式制度的规定而忽略非正式规则的变通,那一定会得出非常错误的认识和结论。

与财政分成和包税制相一致的安排是,朝廷或者上一级政府总是希望下级政府减少对上级政府的财政依赖度,尽量使之最小化,让下级政府成为一个依靠其资源禀赋和财源生存的自给单位。只有在重大饥荒和灾害的情况下,上级政府才会启动应急机制,给予一些救济和补助。这可以解释在历史上中央对地方之间的转移支付的规模何以那么小,也可以解释为什么中国各地区之间的经济发展和人均财政支出水平何以差别那么大。值得我们注意的是,这种上级政府要求下级政府尽可能自力更生、实现财政自给的传统治理理念一直延续至当代。

黄仁宇在分析明代财政制度时指出:“因为定额制度和税收收入不足,上级政府通常都将财政责任推给下一级政府,下一级政府为了弥补赤字不得不尽其所能,常常将这些负担转嫁给那些被佥派的民间税收代理人”(黄仁宇,2001,第60页)。漕粮解运京师,运输费用却由纳粮户按比例承担。军队维护理应中央负责,但实际上地方承担几乎全部的财政责任。皇帝要求军队屯田,至于财力、物力则屯军自己筹措。一个更极端的发包制的例子是,作为明代国家最大的修造漕船的工厂之一的清江船厂,被分成82个厂,依次分布在淮河岸边,每个厂的管理者不仅对其正常运转负责,而且还要为造船计划筹措船料费用。最后许多厂官不得不自己背负亏累负欠。

行政发包关系不仅出现在中央至地方政府的各级正式层级之间,还出现在州县官与乡村之间。美国政治学家杜赞奇研究了在清末民初的现代化过程中国家政权力量对乡村的渗透和控制(杜赞奇,1995)。在19世纪末期,县官并不直接与乡村的农民打交道,而是采取国家经纪型体制来征收赋税并实现其统治职能。国家经纪型体制包括两种基本形式,一是“赢利型经纪”体制,即利用下层吏役代理在乡村的各项事务,尤其是包收税赋等,吏役从中获取佣金和非正式的报酬。这是清朝末期国家治理乡村社会的一种主要形式。这些吏役并非国家正式任命的官员,国家基本不给他们薪俸,或者薪俸非常之低,可以看作是县官的雇员。杜赞奇指出:“封建国家的代表——知县,只有将许多行政职能‘转交’给有办事经验的个人或集团,他才能统治约有30万之众的县。而作为回报,这些下层吏役被默许从百姓身上收取‘礼物’而不受严厉惩罚。”(1995,第40页)另一种形式是保护型经纪体制,即村庄自愿组织起来负责征收赋税并完成国家指派的其他任务,以避免与赢利型经纪打交道,而出面承担组织和协商任务的通常是乡绅。在第二种形式下,国家在征收赋税和摊派的过程中是以村庄而不是土地所有者的个人为对象,村庄自己制定向各户摊派的办法。正如杜赞奇所指出的那样,在清末民初的现实中,这两种国家型经纪体制的边界有时并不清晰。首先,当国家的财政需求不断增加的时候,乡绅在征收捐税时难免以公谋私,保护型功能最终让位给赢利型体制;其次,在清朝臭名昭著的“包揽”型体制(即由地方劣绅代征粮钱)反映了保护型和赢利型体制的合一。一方面,地方劣绅代平民纳税而从中收取佣金,另一方面,乡绅代他人纳税也有保护性质,它在一定程度上避免了吏役的掠夺。总之,一方面是国家向吏役和乡绅发包各种事务,尤其是征收赋税,另一方面是承包方经费自筹,并从中获取正式和非正式报酬,与乡村以上的政府间关系非常类似。

晚清政府在征收商税时也采取了包税制,即将商税征收转包给私人团体,如牙人。牙人的最初职能是将交易双方撮合到一起,在当时没有商业立法保护商人收益的情况下,牙人作为交易的见证人可以为交易提供一定的保证,并提供标准度量服务。民国以后,牙人的主要职能转向了征取商税。县政府邀请各包税人投标,中标者充当包税人,他也可以将征收市场上的某种商品税收权转包给中层包税人,后者又转包或雇佣集市甚至农村的商人代其征取商税(杜赞奇,1995,第219—221页)。

上述这些例子清楚地说明,古代时期尤其明清以来的政府管理体制中存在一种明显的逐级层层发包的倾向,在名义上是“统收统支”的集中预算管理,实际上是典型的“财政包干制”。行政事务的逐级发包和财政包干制是相互支持的。中央尽可能把行政事务层层分解给基层政府[^16] ,同时也尽可能把财政责任交给基层政府,允许它们自筹经费。明清时期州县官的名义薪俸非常之低,不足以维持家庭的基本开支,更不用说聘任幕僚和支付官场的应酬。这种低薪的安排进一步表明一切行政经费尽量地方自筹的财政包干原则。这样,在中央层面,需要处理的事务相对集中,主要维持一个发号施令的权力机构,而不用关心实施中央指令所需的财政经费问题。

在历史上,行政逐级发包和属地管理一直是高度合一的。[^17] 行政逐级发包从来都是以属地为原则进行的,实行“块块”管理;“条条”管理在古代非常少见。古代的漕运和盐政有点类似于现今的条条管理,但是漕运和盐政仍然是按照属地化的原则管理的,即它们所要求的人员、经费和后勤都是由属地地方政府负责的。按属地为单位进行行政发包便于界定地方官员作为承包方的行政责任,地域边界决定了责任边界,便于实施“谁主管,谁负责”的原则。

综上所述,行政逐级发包制概括了古代中国政府间关系的几个基本特征:

第一,委托人的发包指令是逐级向下传递的;层级越高的指令越具有权威性,越具有否决权。皇帝作为最高级别的发包方,可以自主决定发包的方式和内容,即所谓的机制设计权,因而是一切权力的中心和来源,地方官员的权力从正式意义上说均是皇帝相机授权的结果。这可以说明中国古代行政体制的高度集权的一方面,

第二,每一级“承包方”只对直接的上一级负责,并以满足它的要求为主,因为它可以在很大程度上决定本级承包方的去留,即“县官不如现管”。这可以解释一个悖论性的现象,一方面,层级越高,权力越大,否决权越大,另一方面,就每一级政府官员的命运而言,直接的上级,而不是最高层,有实际上的决定权和处置权。这种安排容易导致相邻行政层级之间的串谋,共同对付更高级别的监督,同时也经常导致下级官员对于上级领导的人身依附关系。给定监督费用的存在和串谋的可能,中央对下级政府的监督能力是逐级下降的。“谁来监督监督者”成为一个巨大的挑战。地方官员手里由此掌握了大量的自由裁量权或合法伤害权,这造成了中国行政管理体制实际上高度分权的事实。

第三,逐级发包的任务最后落实到最基层的承包方具体实施,而它之上的所有发包方都只是在传递指令和监督执行;只有县官是具体管事的,与普通老百姓打交道,而在此之上的官员都是管人的,不直接为老百姓提供服务。这说明上级和下级政府的事权不是分工协作关系,而是层层发包和逐级监督的关系,政府间职责高度重叠和覆盖。[^18]

第四,地方政府尤其是基层政府承包了几乎所有的公共事务,面临来自上级的人格化的问责压力、刚性的财政上解任务,而帝国财政制度赋予的财力又是极其有限的,这导致了地方政府以各种方式征收附加税,寻求“预算外”收入。当然地方政府施加的苛捐杂税不完全都是弥补预算内财力的不足,相当一部分其实变成了各级地方官员及办事人员的个人收入。

上述这些特征孕育在古代政府治理的体制之中,历经几百年的沧桑变化,即使到了今天,我们仍然可以看到它们留下的深刻印记。

2.4 新中国成立以来的演变

新中国成立以来,中国政府治理体制发生了一系列重要变化,在不同层面上对传统的属地化行政发包制进行了程度不同的改造。在计划经济时期,最引人注目的一个变化是众多中央垂直管理部门的出现,中央垂直管理和传统的属地管理模式相结合形成了条块管理的新格局。上世纪50年代初,中国采取“一边倒”的战略,全面模仿苏联模式,政府对经济活动的管理强调中央各部委的直接计划管理,形成以“条条”为主的经济管理体制。全国大型国营企业均由中央工业部门直接领导,地方和企业的基本建设计划绝大部分由中央部委集中统一管理,主要物质的分配权和定价权、劳动力配置和工资水平的决定等等也都是由中央集中控制。发生这些变化的原因不难理解,新中国成立之初计划经济体制的确立和迅速工业化的目标势必加强中央对经济和社会事务的计划控制,如能源、原材料、钢材的计划调配,工业产品跨地域生产和销售,人员异地调动等等。地域之间的人、财、物的频繁流动需要有中央机构管理跨地域事务,而传统的纯粹属地发包模式根本无法满足这些新的要求。

为了加强对农业、农村和农民的管理,最大限度地控制农业剩余,使之为大规模工业化服务,基层政府的建制从传统的县延伸到乡镇一级,乡镇干部列入政府的正式编制,由上级任命。由于全国乡镇干部的数目太多,古代一直沿袭下来的朝廷任命所有正式官员的传统自然不可能再继续下去了。新中国成立后县乡基层干部不由中央任命,而是由省级政府任命,实行下管两级的人事管理模式。[^19] 国家政权下沉到乡镇一级,极大地加强了国家对农村经济社会资源的动员能力和汲取能力。

与此同时,新中国成立之后的政府间关系还加入了极为独特的党政关系,贯彻“党管干部”的基本原则。政府部门的权力高度集中于党委,党委实行“一元化”领导。党政干部的观念和行为受到党的意识形态和组织路线的深刻影响。

然而,上述三个方面的重要变化并没有彻底改变中国政府治理的传统模式。相反,属地化行政发包制的一些核心特征仍然被新中国承袭下来了,并和上述三个方面的发展形成有趣的互动、耦合和演化,使得新体制的方方面面都被烙上了旧体制的深刻印记。

从各级政府行政管理的事项范围来看,除了国防和外交之外,中央政府与省、地级市、县非常相似,地方政府的事权几乎是中央政府的翻版,仍然是一个层层重叠的设计架构。政府间事权的划分不是按照公共产品的外溢范围(全国性还是地方性公共产品)、而是根据行政隶属关系和属地原则进行人为切割和分解。上级政府与下级政府之间的分工很少,基层政府分担了绝大多数的行政、经济和社会管理事务的具体执行。[^20] 这就是所谓“上下对口”“上下一般粗”的特征。从这些方面看,新中国的政府间关系仍然具有浓厚的行政发包制的色彩。而新中国成立之后实行下管两级的人事制度,允许地方政府任命某些层级的干部,以及在乡镇一级建立基层政府,事实上进一步加强了行政逐级发包的性质。

在中央和地方的行政权分配中,中央负责制定大政方针,但中央制定的这些国家层面的战略和政策绝大部分是由下级政府具体实施,即“大权独揽,小权分散”。中央保留重大决策权、否决权和干预权,但事权下放,下级政府拥有大量的自由裁量权。中央统摄重要的人事权,上级控制的人事权主要体现在对直接的下一级,而不是对所有的官员。中央每次提出重大经济和社会发展目标和战略之后,各级地方政府都要层层传达和部署,战略目标也不断被分解下达。在这个过程中,各级地方政府被赋予了相当的自主性去实施上级的任务和目标,如果把各级地方政府基于自由裁量权而进行的“创造性”实践(既有积极意义上的政策变通和制度创新,也有消极意义上的应付和走形式)包括在内,则更是如此。

即使在最强调权力集中和全局协调的经济计划方面,行政发包的色彩也是明显的。中央制定全国的经济计划,通常拟定一个初步轮廓,确定一些控制数字,然后交给各部门、各省市编制自己的规划,然后由中央汇总平衡(薄一波,1991,第290页)。省一级又进一步向下分解,同时谋求在本省范围的计划平衡。由于中国一直缺乏专业统计和计划人员,经济计划的覆盖面和精确度无法和苏联老大哥相比,全国性的计划其实是每个部门和省区力图寻求自我平衡的过程,有时甚至不得不允许企业通过灰色市场去购买所需的原材料。所以中国的计划经济一直就具有中央计划和地方计划相结合的特征,计划制定过程更像是将计划指标层层分解、层层分包的过程。

古代传统的属地化分级管理模式也以一种“路径依赖”的方式得以延续,而且还有新的发展。新中国成立以后中央和地方的关系由传统的块块管理演变成“条块结合,以块为主”:块块管“人、财、物”,而垂直部门重要负责“业务指导”,这与苏联强调条条管理的U型结构相区别。在过去很长时间里,中央垂直部门在地方的分支机构仍然在人事和财政上由地方政府支配,中央条条部门并没有一个从上到下的独立执行机构,即编制、人事和财务完全与地方独立的机构,这使得中央要做任何事情都必须得到地方政府的配合。1958—1976年间中央和地方之间经历的几次放权与收权运动都是在属地和行政隶属关系的范围内进行的。

中国在50年代初引入苏联高度集权的经济管理模式,将行政集权与经济集权相结合,是对政府间关系的一次重大调整。但这种移植体制在中国经历了短暂的实验之后,很快就与中国传统的属地管理模式发生了严重的冲突。冲突的根源是经济计划所要求的垂直管理和整齐划一与中国属地化行政发包制度所需的“各自为政”和“因地制宜”之间的矛盾。1956年毛泽东论“十大关系”其实就是在传统体制与外来体制之间产生冲突的背景下提出的。毛泽东在《论十大关系》中批评了苏联的过度集中的计划体制,提出要调动中央和地方“两个积极性”的问题。新中国成立以后第一次大规模的权力下放运动由此启动,体现了中国传统属地化分级管理模式的顽强力量。之后中央和地方的关系几经调整,但地方分权化成了主旋律。

计划经济时期政府间财政关系也很好地体现了从集权到分权的变化,并非像人们普遍认为的那样一直维持“统收统支”的集权体制。[^21] 50年代初新中国建立了全国统一的财政体制,中央集中了全国大部分的财政收入,并对地方财政支出进行集中管理。从1954年开始,统收统支的体制逐渐被打破,财政包干的因素被引入。到了1958年,伴随着中央向地方政府大规模分权和地方工业的兴起,财政体制也进一步走向分权化。“大跃进”造成的经济混乱局面致使中央决定收权,重新回到集中管理。70年代初中国又开始了新一轮大规模的地方分权,地方财政支出占全国财政支出的比例不断上升,1978年已经接近52.6%。70年代后期中央已经开始了财政包干制的试点改革。从这些方面看,中国的财政体制即使在计划经济时期已经呈现高度分权的特征,与计划、投资、物质分配等方面的分权化相一致。当时各种包干形式的制度也时有出现,如基建大包干、财政包干等等。

在微观层面上,属地管理和行政发包进行了奇妙的组合和发展,形成了独具中国特色的组织单元,这就是城市的单位制和农村的人民公社。城市居民生活在各类行政、企业、事业单位里,即使无业在家的待业青年也属于街道居民委员会管理;广大的农民则被组织在政社合一的人民公社体制之下。我们一般把国家行政机关、学校、社会团体和公有制企业等都统称为“单位”,几乎所有的城市居民都隶属于某个相对独立的单位组织。[^22]

单位制有两个非常鲜明的特征:首先,单位是一个准行政的基层组织,政治、经济和社会功能高度合一,它承担了政府应该承担的大量职责,比如协助组织基层人大代表的选举,落实计划生育和拥军优属政策,传达中央文件精神,向单位成员提供就业(包括子女)、医疗、养老、住房(规模大一些的单元还有自己的小学和中学)等几乎无所不包的基本服务和保障。即使作为纯粹的生产经营单位的企业也采取了单位制“小而全”的模式,企业职工的医疗卫生、社会保障、子女教育和就业等等事务都属于企业的管辖范围,即所谓的“企业办社会”。这方面最典型的例子包括企业为解决职工子女的就业问题而兴办劳动服务公司,为职工举办托儿所、幼儿园。在这个意义上,单位被认为是一种层级更低的行政管理单元,承接了政府发包的政治、经济和社会的各项事务,单位领导就成为政府在单位的代理人。和地方政府一样,单位组织也呈现“全能化”的倾向。单位组织可以看作是中国政府过程在纵向上的“末梢”,它不属于一级政权组织,但却属于政府的在非政府组织的延伸(朱光磊,2002,第306页)。

其次,单位是高度属地化的管理组织,单位成员的工作、生活完全依赖于其所隶属的组织。政府和单位之间的联系以垂直控制为主,各单位之间自发和自愿的横向联系,除非是政府所指定的,一般是禁止的。个人也不允许在单位之间自由流动,单位成员与外界的一切联系均通过单位这个界面发生。即使到了80年代末90年代初,如果没有单位开证明,到外地出差住旅馆都成问题。事实上,离开了单位组织,个人很难生存,而个人这种对组织的高度依赖性最后演化为个人对组织的完全服从,进而为国家对社会进行有效动员奠定了坚实的微观基础。

1958年以后成立的人民公社是与城市单位制在农村的对应物,两者极具同构性。人民公社是集政治、经济、社会于一体的单元,农民的生产劳动、医疗保障、子女教育都在公社范围内进行,并由公社筹资解决。用毛泽东的话说,“还是人民公社好,它的好处是,可以把工、农、商、学、兵结合在一起,便于领导。”(《人民日报》1958年8月10日)人民公社这一模式还被推广到城市,学校、工厂、街道都办成公社,成为工农商学兵相结合以及政社合一的社会组织。后来城市人民公社因浪费严重、组织成本过高而最终被放弃了。人民公社实行的是高度的党的“一元化”领导,党委包办几乎一切事务。

单位制和人民公社把社会全体成员都置于组织的管理和控制之下,政府管理社会的交易成本大幅度下降了。政府不需直接接触个人,而只需与单位组织发生关联。社会呈现出一个两极结构:一极是权力高度集中的国家与政府,另一极则是大量相对分散和相对封闭的一个一个的单位组织(李汉林,2004)。而大量的政治、经济和社会事务则是由政府发包给各个单位去负责管理和实施。这让我们想起中国传统乡村的宗族组织作为准行政单位的性质。事实上,单位组织和我们传统的家族文化以及传统的家族组织与制度有着割不断的联系和影响(李汉林,2004)。

1978年开启了中国改革开放的新时代,在接下来的30多年的时间里政府治理体制进行了一系列重大改革。从我们的视角看,这段时期制度调整与改革直接涉及政府间行政发包制的一系列深刻的变化,其中主要包含了两个时期,首先是80和90年代属地化管理和行政发包进一步强化的时期,其次是2000年以来行政发包制经历局部改造的时期。

1979年开始,中央实施“简政放权”,即把一些属于中央部委的行政管理权和经济管理权限下放给地方,主要下放给了地方政府;许多原来属于中央直属的企业交给地方政府所有;这被学术界称为“行政性放权”,因离期望的“经济性放权”(向企业放权)太远而屡受抨击。尽管如此,行政性分权仍然开启了一个政府间关系的新时代,自此以后地方政府逐渐获得了越来越多的自主决策的权力,如投资决策权、吸引外资的权力、企业的管理权、对外贸易权等等。深圳、厦门、珠海和汕头被开辟为经济特区,享有别的地区没有的一些经济管理权力,成为经济改革和开放的试验区,加上自1984年开始建立计划单列市以及14个沿海开放城市,都代表了中央条条部门的权力进一步向地方一级下放和转移。这些权力的下放增加了新中国以来条块管理中“块块”的权重,使地方政府从计划经济体制下一个被动的执行者变成积极的管理者,大大调动了地方政府参与改革和发展的积极性。

1980年以来,我国的干部人事管理制度有一系列重要改革。首先,在地方干部选拔和晋升标准方面,中央强调干部的“革命化、年轻化、知识化、专业化”,尤其是注重地方官员在推动经济发展方面的绩效。其次,在人事任命上由过去的“下管两级”过渡到“下管一级”的新制度,这赋予了地方政府对下一级官员的正式任命权。由“下管两级”过渡到“下管一级”使得中央管理的干部减少了三分之二,由原来的1.3万多人减少到4200多人,其余的近9000名干部交给了地方组织部门管理。地方各级党委根据新的干部管理体制也相应下放了人事权,直接管理的干部也相应减少了三分之二(陈凤楼,2003,第238页)。在人事任命上,“下管一级”的体制更接近行政逐级发包的特征。

改革开放以来,中国沿袭了中央提出重大经济社会发展目标、各级地方政府层层传达和部署、层层分解与包干的做法。80年代中期以来政府间各种形式的“责任状”和量化的目标责任制成为政府间行政管理的惯例,目标责任制涵盖经济发展、计划生育、环境治理、扶贫救济、疾病预防等政府职责的各个方面(荣敬本等,1998;王汉生、王一鸽,2009)。尤其在经济发展和招商引资上,各地政府间通常采取签订政府责任状的形式,下级政府或部门领导对这些数字指标承担行政责任。计划生育对地方官员长期采取“一票否决”的问责制。“压力型体制”和“政治承包制”越到基层表现越为明显。近年来关于地方政府处理维稳和信访问题,中央明确提出“包息包讼”的要求,信访治理在基层流行“包保责任制”(田先红,2012)。

在环境治理方面,领导责任包干制较为普遍。例如,无锡为治理太湖的污染,2008年首次推出“河长制”,由无锡市党政主要负责人分别担任64条河流的“河长”。河长制被云南昆明借鉴用于治理滇池,逐渐在全国推广。浙江省为进一步推进水环境综合治理,2013年也大规模实施“河长制”,从省长、市长、县长到乡镇长,全省至少有1500名“河长”“上岗”工作。在一些地方,甚至在村一级还设立了由村官担任的“河(段)长”,层层落实,层层分解,把责任具体落实到每一个河流的断面。浙江省兰溪市地处金华江的下游、钱塘江的中上游,是金华、衢州两市大部分河水的交汇地,治水任务十分繁重。因兰江支流浒溪的排污问题被媒体曝光,兰溪市委书记吴国成向浙江省有关部门立下“军令状”:由他来任这条兰溪最脏河流的“河长”。[^23]

包干制也引入地区的产业发展的指导和规划。例如,2008年金融危机之后上海决心发展先进制造业,列出九大高新技术产业作为发展重点,以上海市委市政府领导“责任包干”的方式加以落实,上海市委书记亲自挂帅落实“新能源”和“新能源汽车”;上海市市长落实“民用航空制造业”和“先进重大装备”。在很多地区,重要企业和重大项目也经常是以领导包干的方式进行日常管理和责任落实,既便于工作分工,又利于发挥领导的潜能。

更关键的是,对于上级指定的任务目标,下级政府通常需要全力调动自身的财政和其他资源去完成,经常的情况是“中央请客,地方买单”,或者“上级点菜,下级买单”。而为了完成上级任务和筹集必要的财政资源,地方政府又是“八仙过海,各显神通”。这对应着行政发包制中的财政和预算包干制的情形。行政发包制的“财政分成”特征在改革开放之后尤其突出。上世纪80年代初期开始至1993年中国财政体制进入了一个较为彻底的“财政包干制”的时代:“交够中央的,剩下就是省里的”。1994年进入“分税制”时代之后,中央和地方仍然是在维持过去的事权分配的基础上实现不同税种收入的分享,行政事务的层层发包格局并未改变,省以下还是“财政包干制”。预算外资金长期以来在地方政府的财政收入中占据重要比例,一直扮演着补偿地方政府预算内收入不足的角色。[^24]

除了从中央到地方各级政府间实行“财政包干制”,各色各样的“包干制”贯穿了中国许多经济和非经济领域的改革。1979年农村地区推行联产责任承包制,即所谓的“包产到户”。1981年国营工业企业中开始推行经济责任制,给予企业更多的经营自主权,但与此同时强化企业对国家的经济责任,即上缴利税的责任。经营承包责任制成为80年代至90年代初期国有企业改革的一个基本思路。虽然承包经营的形式各异,但基本思路是“包死基数,确保上交,超收多留,欠收自补”(宋新中,1997年,第481—482页)。1987年,中国进入全面的包干制,在企业、财政、外贸、投资、信贷五大领域实行划块包干。

“包干制”还推广到了事业、行政单位的预算管理制度。改革开放之前事业单位和行政机关的预算管理基本上采取统收统支的形式。从1980年起,国家对文教、卫生、科学、体育、农业、林业、水利及气象等事业单位和行政机关试行“预算包干”的办法,即经费包干,节余留用,超支不补。与此同时,国家鼓励一切有条件组织收入的事业单位挖掘潜力,合理组织收入,解决经费不足的问题。单位可以从节余的经费中提取一定比例的福利基金和奖励基金,用于改善单位职工的福利待遇。

即使到了今天,预算包干制仍然是一种普遍的行政体制的预算管理方式。在许多地区,行政机关和事业单位(如大学、医院、研究所)的财政预算拨款主要是根据人头费来拨款,只能够保证这些单位最基本的办公经费,除此之外的经费来源必须依靠各种方式创收,比如收费、罚没以及从事营利性活动。这就相当于这些行政机构和事业单位与财政部门签订了一个预算包干合约,上级拨款只负责最基本的支出,超收自用,短收不补,上级部门只给政策不给钱。[^25] 周天勇等(2008)指出目前行政体制最大的问题之一是“税收权的外延”(即行政事业单位的收费行为)和行政事业单位的商业化,使得中国大量的财政收支都高度分散在政府的各个部门,出现了“国家财政部门化”的趋势。这些问题的存在,周雪光(2005)称之为“逆向软预算约束”,从我们的角度看,其实是行政发包制下预算包干的必然产物。

地方政府的工作绩效要接受上级政府的验收考核,这种绩效考核更多是结果导向的,以结果论英雄。行政事务层层发包之后,上级对下级的监察能力其实相对有限,只能依靠例行检查、专项整治和结果考核进行内部控制。尤其在90年代以来政府间各种形式的目标责任制、承包责任制非常盛行,各种评比排名、末位淘汰大行其道。这些做法的核心特征是程序和规则作用的弱化,结果决定一切。

以任务下达和指标分解为特征的行政事务层层发包,高度依赖于各级地方政府和相关部门单位自筹资金的财政分成和预算包干,以结果导向为特征的考核和检查,这三个方面恰好构成了我国政府间关系和行政治理的基本特征。三者相互联系,内在一致,呈现为一个系统的三个侧面,而这正是行政发包制的核心内涵。

80年代初开始事权、财权和人事权依次从中央向地方政府的转移和集结,事实上是突破传统计划经济体制对地方政府的严重束缚,使之变成一个行政、经济和社会事务的真正承包者。苏联高度集权的经济管理体制作为我国曾经全心效仿和强制嵌入的模式终于被彻底摒弃了。在一定意义上,我们又回归到了传统的行政管理体制,即属地化行政逐级发包制,在这种体制下地方政府享有大量的正式或非正式的自主权。所不同的是,在古代传统体制下,地方政府的经济职能非常有限,而1949年以后中国处于工业化和城市化的重要阶段,经济发展成为地方政府的重任,已不是古代两千年长期维持的小农经济所能比拟。改革开放之后,地方政府承担着区域经济改革与发展的重任。后面的发展过程清楚地表明,中国在事权、财权和人事权方面一系列分权改革重新塑造了地方政府在改革开放过程中的特殊角色,为中国改革开放和经济发展注入了前所未有的活力,为一个长达30年的经济高速增长的奇迹奠定了坚固的基础。苏联体制在中国的命运使我们再次认识到传统行政力量的巨大影响,为我们研究体制嵌入问题和制度的路径依赖提供了绝好的案例。

随着地区放权,尤其是邓小平南方谈话之后,中国经济进入一个高速发展时期。价格管制的逐步放开、国企改制和非公有经济的兴起,使得传统的计划经济体制被打破,市场经济日益成为资源配置的主导力量。如果说1949年后计划经济的确立和前苏联模式的引入尚未在根本上冲击传统的政府间关系的基本架构,有些方面属地化发包的特征还有加强(如单位制的形成),那么,市场经济的快速发展所带来的冲击则是根本性的和全方位的。90年代以来,随着市场经济的迅速发展,传统的属地化的行政发包体制正面临着严峻的挑战。

市场经济发展所带来的挑战主要来自两个基本方面。一方面,传统属地化管理的基础——即个人和企业对属地的依赖关系(如个人对户籍和单位的依赖、企业对政府的依赖)在市场力量的冲击下被严重削弱,个人和企业的跨地域流动性不断增强;另一方面,传统的以属地为基础的行政发包制日益成为市场和经济一体化发展的严重障碍。市场化的发展意味着生产要素冲破一切地域的阻隔和壁垒跨地域充分流动,从而在根本上冲击着属地化行政发包制的制度逻辑。下面我们进一步阐释这两方面的挑战的具体含义。

首先,一个值得注意的巨大变化是,新中国成立以后形成的具有属地管理和发包特色的中国单位制在改革浪潮中逐渐瓦解和消失。人民公社制度早在1984年就被废除,联产承包责任制的推行致使农民与乡镇集体的联系大为减弱,与此相联系,以前由集体提供的农村合作医疗和福利制度因经费来源问题难以为继。在城市,始于上世纪90年代中后期的“抓大放小”和国有企业改制致使大量国有企业被拍卖或收购,累计几千万工人下岗。住房制度改革取消了长期以来的单位福利分房的政策。传统的企业办社会的社会福利模式已经彻底退出历史舞台。农民工大量涌入城市,城市职工经常变换工作,跨地流动。个人与单位的联系不再是过去的依附和隶属关系,更多是一种市场契约关系,员工进入和退出单位变得非常自由。企业和个人不再固定地束缚于某个属地。在跨地域流动性不断增强的条件下,属地化管理面临的问题越来越多,管理效率将不断降低。比如随着单位制的消失,居民小区等各类社区成为城市基层政府面对的治理对象,社会管理模式必须创新。另外,城市居民的医疗保险和社会保障已经逐渐脱离所在单位,走向社会化管理的模式,但目前仍然采取属地管理的原则,这和人们跨区域流动性不断加强的事实必然产生矛盾。

其次,市场经济的一体化与传统的属地化行政发包制的冲突日益突出。这里我们试举两例加以说明。第一个例子是大众非常关注的“假冒伪劣商品”的问题。从80年代后期以来,产品质量问题一直困扰着广大的消费者和企业,各种假冒伪劣商品泛滥成灾,制假贩假技术也是“日新月异”,令人目不暇接。近年来中国产品的质量问题在国外市场上不断引起关注,还演变成中美经济战略对话的议题之一。在这个问题的背后当然和中国目前的经济发展和市场发育阶段有关,如产业集中度低,一些中小企业不关心产品的名牌和长期声誉,成为假冒伪劣产品的生产和销售主体。除此之外,产品质量问题还与政府监管缺位和司法裁决惩罚不力有着密切关系(周黎安、崔兆明,1996)。中国目前产品质量问题仍然是以属地管理为主要原则,而地方政府和司法部门均有地方保护主义倾向,为了当地经济发展,不愿意对本地的企业采取严格的监管和执法。Eberhardt等(2014)发现,各省治理违规虚假医药广告的案例中来自外省企业的广告占了90%以上,也就是说,所谓的处罚虚假广告其实是变相地保护本地企业和官员的利益。与此相联系的是司法地方保护主义,它不仅表现在对假冒伪劣产品和知识产权保护的处理上,在其他一些领域也程度不同地存在,比如对上市公司的违法行为的判决。这使得我们缺乏独立于属地影响的全国统一的司法体系,严重影响了市场经济中的产权保护和司法公正。

第二个例子是关于企业和个人征信体系的建设问题。市场经济的发展需要建立在个人和企业的信用之上,而社会征信体系的建立必须依赖于一种高度集中的信息数据库。在发达国家(如美国、日本),私人企业经营的征信业为全社会潜在用户有偿提供个人和企业的征信服务,一个人或企业一旦有失信记录将失去贷款、租房等许多机会。征信记录体系是市场经济运行的基石之一。在中国目前的情况下,征信业尚不发达,更严重的问题在于,企业和个人的基础信息和信用信息分散在各个属地和职能部门之间,当前我国条块分割的信息管理体制导致征信信息过度属地化和分散化,无法在一个全国统一的信息平台上进行整合。

医疗和社会保障服务体系的建立同样面临上述问题,即如何从一个以属地为原则的保障服务体系过渡到全国统一的保障服务体系,以最大限度地实现规模经济收益,保证基本公共服务的均等化,同时又为公民的自由迁徙提供便利。目前统计、环境保护仍然具有非常强烈的“块块”管理的特征,受到属地分级管理的支配和影响。

这些例子说明,传统的属地化行政发包制无法解决全国性公共产品的提供问题,如稳定的金融秩序、良好的产品质量监管体系、统一的司法体系、全国性医疗和社会保障体系、企业和个人征信体系等。而这些公共产品构成市场有效秩序的技术和制度基础。如前所述,在属地化分级管理模式下,社会公共产品的提供不是按照公共产品的覆盖范围而是按照行政隶属关系和属地化原则管理。属地化的行政发包制的核心是将一切经济和社会事务尽可能发包给一个个相对分割的属地,以减轻中央的统辖负担,而不论这些事务的性质是属于局部的公共产品还是跨地域的全国性的公共产品(如教育、司法服务、产品质量信息、个人与企业的诚信信息、社会保障等)。地方官员之间的政治锦标赛则进一步固化了这些全国性公共产品的属地化和局部化的特征。因此,那些本质上属于全国性公共产品的经济和社会事务在属地间进行了人为的切割。[^26]

以1994年分税制改革为起点,中国进入了一个长时段的“垂直管理的收权浪潮”。分税制改革对中央税和地方税进行区分,相应地,在机构设置上也成立了国税局,与地税局分开,国税局由中央直接提供行政经费,人员任命权也独立于地方政府。这改变了过去由地方政府代收的做法。中国“条条”部门的垂直化管理出现两个特点。一是中央推行对国税、银行、海关、海事和粮食储备管理等部门的中央垂直管理;二是对“条条”部门的省(市)层级上的垂直管理,如2000年工商、技术监督、药品检验监督等部门由以前的“块块”管理变成省以下的垂直管理体系。[^27] 一方面是越来越多的部门垂直管理,另一方面越来越多的跨省区的大区督察的设立,在一些区域中心城市,如上海、广州、成都等,已云集了银监、证监、审计、环保、国土等来自不同中央部门的大区机构,对地方形成近距离监督的态势。所有这些改革,一方面是满足市场经济发展提出的新的要求,另一方面,分税制改革之后的中央财力的大幅度上升为改革奠定了雄厚的物质基础。

在这些收权过程中,有一些重要的变化值得注意。在1993年以前,中国实行“条块管理,以块为主”的原则,即条条部门只提供业务指导,人财物均由地方政府提供,“属地化管理”的色彩非常浓厚。所以垂直管理不得不受到地方利益的牵制,尤其是地方政府控制了垂直部门在地方执行机构的人事任命权,当地方利益与垂直部门的利益出现冲突时,地方利益通常占据主导。当前的垂直管理与以前的“条条”管理的不同之处是,在人事任命、人员编制、机构设置和财政经费等方面完全由上级统一管理,而不再依赖于地方政府。国税、海关和银行的垂直化管理旨在突破属地的约束,让部门的管理真正摆脱地方政府的利益牵制。最近司法的垂直化管理进入正式的改革议程。在这个意义上,这些改革真正触及到了中国流行了两千多年的属地化管理体制的核心。

2.5 行政发包程度和范围的决定因素

虽然我们用行政发包制概括中国政府间关系和政府治理的核心特征,但在政府管理的不同领域,行政发包程度还是有差异的。[^28] 国防、外交、铁路都是中央直接控制,行政发包成分很少,一些长期性或阶段性国家级战略产业和项目(如航天技术、南水北调工程)也是以中央管理为主,地方支持为辅。教育、医疗卫生、环境治理、扶贫救济等则是属地层层发包管理的事务。当然,即使在国家级项目上,如航天技术和南水北调工程,也存在局部发包的成分,如地方属地上的支持;所以与那些较为纯粹的属地发包制相比更多的是一种程度的区别。有些领域,如人民银行和海关,曾经是属地发包式的管理模式,后来改为中央垂直管理。因此,一个核心问题的是:行政发包事务的范围和程度是如何决定的?

关于行政发包和科层治理的决定因素,我们在理论层面上延续威廉姆森交易费用经济学的思路(Williamson,1975,1985),将行政治理的基本分析单位聚焦于单项的政府事务或由需求方(公众)和供给方(政府)完成的行政服务交易。行政服务的类型和特性本身决定行政治理模式的选择。Hart,Vishny和Shleifer(1997)从不完全契约理论出发,以监狱管理为例,考察了政府服务内部生产和外部发包的边界和范围。他们认为监狱管理的质量要求和成本压力是决定该项公共服务是政府内部提供还是外包给市场的核心因素。我们沿袭了他们的研究思路,但是在行政治理的背景下拓展了公共服务的质量要求和成本压力的具体内涵,尤其是引入了合法性预期、统治风险和财政约束等新的分析维度。概括起来,主要有两大类的因素决定行政发包程度和范围,一类因素与公共服务的需求有关,涉及公众或公共服务对象对政府服务的质量要求以及这些质量要求对发包方形成的责任压力;第二类因素与公共服务的供给有关,涉及公共服务提供所需付出的各类成本。[^29]

先说公共服务的需求。公共服务区别于私人服务的根本点在于,私人服务只和个人的偏好满足相关,而公共服务具有一定的政治属性,如公众是否可以参与公共服务的集体决策,是否依法行政,是否体现公平和公正的原则,公众有抱怨是否可以起诉和投诉,官员是否面临公众问责等等,都是与公共服务相伴随的质量特征。而公众的质量偏好和权利意识的强度,或者说公众对公共服务质量的敏感度与问责诉求、合法性预期及权利意识又密切相关。公众这些对于公共服务的质量诉求,最终能否成为对发包方的有效约束和压力,则取决于相关的政治制度安排,如是否通过选举决定政治家的当选、司法是否独立、行政决策和行为是否受到法律约束等等,这些政治变量在目前的行政发包制理论中属于外生给定的参数。

周黎安、王娟(2012)从上述角度解释了赫德为什么摈弃了清朝传统的行政发包治理模式,引入西方严格的科层制治理中国的海关行政。赫德主持的外籍税务总司作为一个代理方,面临多个利益冲突的委托方,如清朝的总理衙门、各国的驻华使节和外国商人,这些都是独立和强势的利益集团,任何一方遇到不公正待遇,都会强烈和公开地表达出来,对总税务司造成问责压力。为了避免各方可能产生的质疑,赫德的应对是确立现代的科层制,以集中的行政权力,严格的预算管理,接近于效率工资的薪水和福利待遇[^30] ,清晰严格的程序和规则,打造一个高效和清廉的海关行政队伍,接受所有相关委托人的监督和问责。赫德还成立一个由中方官员、外方领事和税务司构成的法庭和仲裁委员会,处理可能产生的纠纷和诉讼,给予商人上诉和申诉的机会。为避免被起诉或投诉,维护规章制度和规则程序的有效性、控制自由裁量权就成为赫德着力打造的目标;信息公开、程序透明和高效率是赫德应对各方问责的“利剑”。正是这种多元化的利益诉求和问责压力使得政治家(代理人)必须按照法律和规则办事,要求政府机构建立并严格遵守规则和程序。

在上述框架下,我们也可以理解为什么在中国古代盛行税收承包制。给定中国各地如此复杂的地形条件以及耕地和人口的持续变化,别说中央无法获得各地田亩和人丁的实际数字,即便县官也难以实时掌握这些信息。在这种情况下,与其严格按照官方税率征收并实施税收上解,还不如规定一个固定化的税额。固定化的税额至少带来三个好处:一是便于上级政府的控制和问责,不用监督具体实施过程;二是减少了地方官员可能编制各种借口或造假而少交税的自由裁量权(如隐瞒人口和土地的增长);三是便于百姓监督,朱元璋甚至下令把每县的纳税额刻在石头上,竖在村头,不让地方官吏随意征税。所以,从中央来说,收取一个大致固定的税额是一个非常理性的选择。

公共服务还有一个区别于私人服务的重要维度,那就是公共服务带来的潜在的统治风险。统治风险主要包括国家分裂、社会暴动和革命对统治权带来的直接威胁(我称之为直接的统治风险),以及社会经济方面的失序和波动带来的不稳定,如金融和债务危机、大规模失业和巨大的贫富差距引起的社会不满,我称之为间接的统治风险。[^31] 公共服务带来的统治风险与公共服务的质量压力是密切相关的,之所以出现直接或间接的统治风险是因为统治者未能有效提供最基本的公共服务,或者提供的公共服务质量远低于预期引发了公众的强烈不满。

显然,潜在的统治风险是治理机制的设计者必须考虑的核心因素之一。不同国家因政治体制的差异,同样的公共服务面临的统治风险也各不相同。在美国联邦制下,联邦、州和地方政府的行政首脑均由辖区内的选民选举产生,各自的职责边界相对清晰,作为有限政府,行政首脑所负的行政责任也是相对有限的。比如地方政府债务超过一定临界水平地方政府可以宣布破产;如果经济形势不好,或出现重大社会和经济失序,民众重新选举新的政府上台。在成熟发达的民主政体下,直接的统治风险小,所需防范的是间接的统治风险。对于政府债务的潜在危险,各级政府的议会对政府预算和发债规模进行控制。如果议会控制失效,最后的防护栏是政府破产或政府更替。而在类似中国这样的威权体制下,在应对统治风险方面(如债务风险)面临两个问题,第一,各级地方政府的决策和行为除了受制于上级政府的以外,横向的制约和监督力量相对弱小;这样容易导致统治风险的发生(如债务风险、暴力拆迁导致群体性事件和上访)(曹正汉等,2013)。第二,任何层级政府的问题和隐患如果处理不好都有可能演化成为中央政府的问题和隐患,中央政府成为各种社会和经济问题引发的统治风险的最终承担者。所以,与西方成熟的民主政体相比,集权政体的最高统治者对于各种潜在的统治风险非常敏感,许多中央层面的严密管制都是针对统治风险的控制而设计的。

从公共服务的供给角度看,提供公共服务的成本因素包括两类成本:一是财政或预算成本,提供公共服务耗费人力、物质投入等相关成本,需要由财政或预算投入支付,而这些投入又取决于征税和收费的成本。这是发包方和承包方都必须面对的财政和预算约束。二是发包方监督和协调承包方(代理人)的成本,即代理人成本,这方面的成本与政府治理的疆域大小、层级多少以及代理人的数量直接相关。

这里要特别强调发包方所面临的财政约束,这是流行的委托代理理论或政府治理理论涉及较少的方面。[^32] 中央政府面临的财政压力是导致发包制的一个极为重要的因素,而财政约束更多是与国家税收征收能力相关联。在古代,“王政不下县”的约束之一是国家对农业剩余汲取能力有限,无法支持一个庞大的官僚组织。80年代初开始中央引入财政包干制也是与当时中央政府面临的财政困难有很大的关联。

需要指出的是,公共服务所面临的质量压力或统治风险与治理成本(财政约束和行政监督成本)之间在威权体制下是一对矛盾,按照相反方向变化。[^33] 委托人采用行政发包制而非科层制可以减少国家治理的财政成本和行政监督成本,但因为赋予了承包方一定的决策权和相当的自由裁量权,又容易导致质量压力和统治风险的上升。因此,委托人在决定是否内部发包以及发包范围时面临一个基本的权衡,即公共事务的质量压力(统治风险)与成本压力之间的权衡,两者难以兼得。如果来自公众的质量压力大,委托人则不得不支付更高的行政成本去满足人们的质量要求。[^34] 如果公共服务的统治风险上升,委托人必须更多采取集中控制、减少发包的方式应对。如果公众的质量压力小,委托人就会更多地考虑节约公共服务的成本,控制成本将成为最重要的优化目标。所以,当委托人面临的质量压力上升的时候,行政治理将更偏向科层制,远离行政发包制。给定公众对服务质量的诉求,治理成本的上升将导致行政治理中发包成分增加,科层制或官僚制的成分减少。这里公共服务的质量压力更多影响到行政治理中规则运用和财政预算包干的比重,统治风险的压力更多影响行政权的集中与下放。

上述关于行政发包制及其决定因素的理论有助于我们理解中国国家治理长期呈现的一系列重要特征,也有助于理解最近十余年中国正在经历的国家治理制度的一些变革。

我们首先来探究中国长期以来推行行政发包制的组织逻辑,或者说隐含在这种特定行政治理模式背后的成本—收益的权衡。

作为所有权力集于一身的中央政府,主要需要完成两项基本任务:一是为广大百姓提供基本的公共服务,维持政权的长期稳定;二是保证下放给行政代理人的权力不被滥用,中央的政令能够畅通无阻。这两项任务本质上是冲突的:一方面,为了给广大百姓更好地提供公共服务,就必须尽可能把权力下放给基层政府,因为基层政府相对来说更了解当地民众对公共服务的偏好;从公共服务的角度,统治者应该尽可能选择分权。另一方面,给定下级政府的官员目标和利益不同于中央政府,下级官员的行为不易监督,权力下放就意味着权力有被滥用的危险,甚至被架空,而且权力下放越是到基层,监督就越困难,权力被滥用的威胁也就越大。所以从监督和控制的角度,统治者应该尽可能选择集权。

统治者的两难选择本质上是一个集权与分权的内在矛盾,而矛盾发生的根源在于信息收集和监督的成本。如果地方政府的行为能够很容易被监督,或有关信息很容易被获得,那么,统治者可以把权力下放而不必担心权力滥用的问题。因此,监督和控制代理人的权力使用是集权组织最大的一项任务,而它在机制设计时最核心的考虑是如何让下属做事的同时不会坏事,在两者冲突中寻求平衡。我们看到的历史上央地关系的不同治理方式(如分封制、官僚制)都是寻求如何平衡集权与分权的利弊的结果。

对于古代统治者来说,在决定采取何种政府间关系的治理方式时面临两个最重要的约束:信息约束和财政约束。第一个约束来自信息不对称所带来的中央政府监督地方政府行为的困难。地方政府作为代理人知道自己是否严格执行了上级的指令,知道自己是否有偷懒、渎职、贪污等行为,而中央或上级政府相对来说不太容易知道。中国古代是一个幅员广阔、自然条件差别很大的国家,交通和通信条件很不发达,中央的一纸命令要传达到基层政府尚要花费数日甚至数月的时间,遑论及时掌握和监督地方官员的动向和行为。即使到了今天如此发达的交通通信设施和众多的媒体,中央监督地方政府还是极其困难,那么古代中央政府要监督和控制地方政府的艰难程度就可想而知了。更致命的问题是,作为辖区内的公众本来比中央政府更了解地方政府的行为,拥有更多的信息,但是古代集权体制实际上排除了民众作为正式监督者的可能。根据经济学的观点,如果中央政府监督越容易,就越容易采用奖励或惩罚手段激励代理人,委托人需要给代理人的授权就越小,权力可以向上集中(Holmstrom and Milgrom,1991,1994)。反之,如果监督非常困难,委托人就可能采取授权和发包的方式让代理人完成工作(Prendergast,2001)。

古代统治者选择是否采取集权型的官僚制,国家税收能力是一个极为重要的约束条件。采取韦伯意义上的官僚制要求提供集中统一的预算和财政支持,如果不采取行政和财政发包的形式,那么中央就需要集中巨大的财力为所有的地方政府提供足额的预算经费,这意味着国家集中的财政收入必须达到某个最低规模。[^35] 而古代国家的征税能力受到两个主要的挑战。首先,在古代小农经济的基础上,农业剩余非常有限,赋税超过一定额度就会引起农民的反抗。其次,中央需要设立高度有效的征税机关,对应税土地和人口的信息充分占有。这一方面涉及古代国家的组织渗透能力,比如如何建立和维持一个类似今天的“国税局”部门,不受地方税务官的影响,另一方面又涉及严重的信息约束问题。如前所述,由于朝廷无法及时准确地掌握土地和人口的信息,最后不得不将国家征收的赋税“定额化”。这两方面的因素解释了古代统治者为什么在名义上采取“统收统支”的高度集权的财政体制,而在实际上却一直默认预算内与预算外双轨运行和财政包干制。

基于上面的分析,我们认为,属地化的行政发包制就是中国古代统治者在治理成本与收益间进行精心权衡与选择的结果,是在信息和财政两个约束下进行理性选择的产物。具体说来,属地化的行政发包制可以实现下面几个方面的收益。

属地化分级管理的“行政发包制”带来的第一个显著收益是节约了管理和监督成本。逐级发包的动因在于尽一切可能节约监督成本,属地化的逐级行政发包相当于把复杂的行政管理事务按地域逐级分解给下级政府,以尽可能减少上级政府的事务负担。与此相适应,政府对跨地域的流民和游民一直严厉控制,以尽可能减少跨地域事务。就中央来说,相比通行的行政发包制和属地化管理而言,面临两种可替代的治理方式,一是建立独立的中央机构去实施中央的指令(即完全垂直管理,类似于U型结构),或者把行政和经济管理事务直接发包给基层政府,或者说直接给基层政府授权,取消所有的中层政府组织。显然,这两类替代方式的治理成本都非常高昂。前一类方案不仅存在严重的监督问题(即如何从上到下监督和控制垂直机构的运行),这个问题在交通和通信技术落后的古代尤为严重,而且需要巨额的财政费用来支持这些中央垂直机构。第二类方式面临数目如此众多的基层政府,监督成本也是非常之高。在这个意义上,用逐级发包的方式将政府职责最后交给基层政府,一方面可以大大节省中央直接监督众多基层政府的成本,另一方面也有力限制了中央机构的数目和人员规模,显著减少了对税赋的需求。据统计,清朝康熙年间官员总数为1.56万人,而其中在京官员的总数仅仅只有2546人。[^36] 事实上,作为一个高度集权的国家,我国中央行政机构的人数在全国行政机关人数的比重一直是非常低,到今天仍然是这样的状况。[^37]

第二,行政发包和属地管理高度整合之后带来的一个好处是,地方官员的行政责任的边界容易清晰界定,就等于其管辖地域的边界,行政责任容易落实。什么地方出了问题,最终可以追究主管行政长官的责任,实施“谁主管,谁负责”的原则,避免了责任不清和相互推诿的问题。而且,一旦遇到紧急情况或重大挑战,中央可以一级压一级的方式把任务和责任迅速落实到最基层,形成所谓“压力型体制”(容敬本等,1998)。这是中国威权体制下高度社会动员能力的主要源泉。属地化行政发包制在减少中央和上级政府的决策负荷的同时,又便利了下级政府行政责任的界定和落实。行政发包和属地管理的高度互补可以解释为什么中国地方政府一直以来都是全能型政府和一元化领导,因为行政发包决定了地方首脑是其属地辖区的总负责人,在行政事务全面发包的同时必须把有关的治理权也一起下放,这样可以保证地方首脑有足够的权力承担其承包的行政责任。

第三,行政发包有助于对下级政府做出关于分权的可信承诺,从而在一个威权体制下给予了地方官员使用权力的稳定空间,相当于为地方官员的自主决策提供了“产权保护”。如果地方官员知道自己的决策经常面临被上级政府否决的危险,他就不会认真去研究决策的后果以及如何做出正确的决策,这种事实上的管理权就像被保护的产权一样可以变成对地方官员独立决策的激励。在中国这样一个幅员辽阔、地区差异巨大的国家,如果真是采取“一刀切”的方式贯彻中央的统一政令,一定会导致行政效率低下。而行政发包所生成的地方实际控制权让地方政府能够对各地的差异性做出灵活反应,使中央的统一政策尽可能因地制宜。当然,这种地方层面上的多样性经常是以“上有政策、下有对策”的自由裁量权的形式实现的,而且有可能演变成地方官员的专断任性和营私舞弊。

第四,在一个高度集权的体制下内生出中央和地方政府之间、上下级政府之间的相互制衡关系。由于中央发布政令最终依赖地方政府的协助、配合和具体执行,中央无法从外部市场上获得竞争性的“承包方”(地方行政服务具有属地性,别的地方政府无法为本地代劳),发包方和承包方的关系在一定意义上被锁定,从而内生出一个威权政体内部上下级政府的相互制衡关系。虽然中央政府在名义上拥有一切权力,可以颐指气使,甚至生杀予夺,但地方政府也可以“消极怠工”和不作为(表面上自然不敢违抗)来威胁中央。中央当然可以换人相威胁,强迫地方政府服从上面的指示。但如果考虑到“临阵换将”的潜在成本,以人事权作后盾形成的威胁最终也是有一定限度的。在此意义上,中央和地方政府之间形成一种类似于“双头垄断”的关系。这种垄断关系的存在使得地方政府必然获得一些“准租金”,即中央政府必须在相当程度上尊重地方的利益诉求,包括地方官员本身的利益,容忍一些腐败行为。[^38] 正是这些“准租金”的存在,给予地方官员巨大的利益空间,使得中国历史上“学而优则仕”,自隋唐以来人们对科举功名趋之若鹜,千方百计挤入政府部门;政府部门也因此可以吸引社会精英加入。

行政发包制蕴含了一种隐性的利益分配和交换机制,与科层制相区别。张静(2014)认为,在发包方和承包方之间有一种默许的交换,即发包方默许承包方的实际控制权,换取承包方对发包方的工作支持,同时又以随时收回默许权力作为威胁,让承包方的自由裁量行为不至于“失控”。我们认为这里有两层含义:第一,在行政发包制下的“层层分包”过程,也是一个“层层分利”的过程,保证了承包方的物质报酬、权力、社会地位等多方面利益;第二,发包方和承包方之间还有一种隐性的权力制衡关系。虽然发包方拥有绝对权力,表面上“生杀予夺”,但承包方可以“消极怠工”和不作为来威胁,这样,发包方和承包方形成了一种微妙的相互制衡的关系。这解释了在行政分包制这种“压力型体制”下为什么还有人愿意(在现实中其实是争相)做承包方的激励。这里最有趣的特征就是发包方和承包方的利益分配、保障及其制衡是以“默许交换”和“潜在威胁”的形式发生的,难以摆在明面上或写在合同里。

所以,行政发包的收益主要体现为中央或上级政府的收集信息的负担减轻,节约了监督成本,与此同时,威权体制下两个最大的隐忧,即下级政府的决策被上级随意否决和下级官员的利益不被尊重的危险,也在一定程度上被行政发包制所克服,从而调动了下级政府进行独立决策的积极性。

有一利必有一弊,行政发包也带来了一系列潜在的问题。逐级行政发包是统治者出于减少监督和决策成本的目的而设置,但它也同时制造了新的监督问题:谁来监督监督者?如前所述,除了最基层的父母官之外,其他官员均是治官之官,为监督的目的所设,这些行使监督之责的中间“转包商”又是由谁来监督呢?这是属地化行政发包制的内在张力。我们看到在历史上有的皇帝(如朱元璋)废除宰相制,大权独揽;有的皇帝不相信手下的大臣,宁愿派太监充当刺探或钦差大臣,巡视地方。历朝历代围绕着从皇帝到基层政府之间的中间督政机构的反反复复的调整和叠床架屋式的设计正说明了这种内在张力的程度。行政发包带来的独立决策空间和准租金也同时带来了地方官员营私舞弊和贪赃枉法的空间,是官吏腐败的来源。历史上无数朝代因为无法治理官吏腐败而导致官逼民反,最终葬送了政权。

这又回到了前面提及的一个核心问题:最高统治者在分权与集权之间权衡,面临的主要约束之一是信息获取的成本,即权力下放的层级越低,官员的行为越难监督。不仅如此,统治者只能在垂直监督的体制下,即一级政府官员只面临上级政府的垂直监督和制约而不受任何其他制约,如公众的监督,选择收权还是放权,信息约束变得非常突出。

西方的科层制是以弱激励(low-powered incentives)的预算体制和公务员收入体系以及低自由裁量权为特征,这显然与政府部门的多任务(multitasking)性质密切相关(Tirole,1994),同时也与民主政治下依法行政和公民的权利诉求有关。然而,在中国,政府官员同样面临多任务的职能,但为什么长期以来是一种强激励(high-powered incentives)和高自由裁量权制度? 为什么中国在政府内部嵌入了一个相对分权和市场化的发包制?前面的解释表明,中国广阔的疆域、各地地域文化和自然条件的巨大差异都是导致科层制治理成本上升的因素,属地发包显然可以显著减少中央治理国家的监督和管理成本。更关键的是,中国国家治理长期贯彻的是自上而下的统治逻辑,普通公民参与国家治理、表达权利诉求的机会有限,加之法治的不完善,使得公共服务质量压力更多让位于治理的成本压力,发包制占据主导形式。对于发包制治理来说,委托人(最高统治者)必须面对各种可能的统治风险,因而在一些重要领域(如人事权、干预权、审批权和指导权)采取集中控制的方式,最大限度防止统治风险的发生,这样就形成了中国集权—分权的独特组合。

属地化层层发包的治理逻辑使得中国中央和地方政府的事权划分呈现许多独特安排。这里我们可以美国联邦制作为比较的参照。首先,美国联邦制根据公共产品的溢出范围(全国性还是地方性)决定联邦与州或地方的事务边界,而中国中央和地方政府职责分工的依据并不是严格按照公共产品收益的溢出范围,如全国性和地方性公共产品的划分。事实上,中国的绝大多数公共服务,包括一些属于全国性公共产品性质的公共服务,如医疗和社会保障,教育,环境治理,都被发包给了地方政府,中央政府出资比例很低。另一方面,一些具有地方公共产品性质的公共事务,又受到中央政府的严格控制,比如国家发改委是根据项目的投资金额大小决定审批权的层级分配,不管公共项目是否属于地方性质,只要投资金额足够大,审批权就属于国家发改委。城市地铁项目虽然严格属于地方性公共项目,对外部溢出效应很小,但因为投资规模巨大,长期以来一定要到国家发改委报批。[^39]

其次,正如我们前面强调的那样,在美国,只要涉及跨州影响的事务都属于联邦政府的职责,而在中国,许多涉及跨省影响的事务,如维护全国统一市场和统一司法秩序以及环境治理,基本上也是采取属地化发包治理的方式,当出现问题时中央更多是寄希望于省际自愿协调,中央层面的治理很少或者成效不大,经常出现各种形式的地方保护主义[^40] 。但有些跨地区事务中央管制却很严,比如跨省传教或组织民间活动。

为什么会出现这种显著差异?我认为,在确定中央和地方事权划分方面,行政发包制更多是根据公共服务所导致的统治风险的溢出范围,而不是公共服务收益的溢出范围。[^41] 只要公共服务本身所涉及的统治风险比较低,来自公众的问责压力低,就尽可能地按照属地发包原则,降低行政成本和财政约束,而非严格遵循公共产品收益的溢出范围。行政发包制更强调提供公共服务的成本维度,同时关注统治风险的控制和防范。美国联邦制关于联邦与州政府的事权划分更强调提供公共服务的质量维度,统治风险的控制不是联邦、州和地方政府事权划分的主要因素。在中国,城市地铁项目虽然属于地方公共产品,但因投资额巨大,其中所涉及的地方政府融资和债务,因地方政府不允许破产以及地方官员不对债务负责,最终可能会演变成中央的债务负担,所以中央政府需要对这一类公共项目的规划和投资进行审查和控制。中国长期以来不允许地方政府发行债务也出于同样的考虑。[^42] 当然,事务发包带来的潜在统治风险以及风险的可控性程度因时因地而变化。中央集权过多容易导致地方政府积极性不足,行政效率低下,治理成本上升,积累到一定限度中央又可能决定放权,出现所谓的“一放就乱,一收就死”,这可以解释为什么中央和地方之间总是存在着收权—分权的更替和循环。

2.6 作为一种理想类型的行政发包制

关于政府治理的特征和运行机制学术界已发展了一系列的概念和理想类型,行政发包制是否可以从这些已有的知识积累中获得独立的价值和地位呢?

人们可能会认为,行政发包制就是一种“行政分权”的方式,那为什么不直接使用“行政分权”或“分权”(decentralization)的概念,反而需要提出“行政发包制”这个概念呢?“行政发包制”确实对应着一种相对分权的治理方式,但其内涵更丰富,通过行政权分配、经济激励和考核控制三个维度能够更加准确地揭示诸如中国政府运行机制的结构性、系统性特征以及内在演变的驱动力,因而是一个更有效的分析概念。首先,行政发包制在三个维度上是一个内在一致、相互支持且协同变化的治理系统。第二,当遇上重大的外部冲击的时候,三个维度都将协同变化,而如果单独改变其中一个维度而其他方面保持不变,则改变的维度有可能难以持久,或者回到原有状态,或者引发另外两个维度的调整。[^43] 第三,相比笼统的“行政分权”概念而言,我们这里提出的行政发包制既涉及剩余和实际控制权在发包方和承包方之间的分配,又涉及剩余索取权的分配,如财政分成、预算包干和人员收入分成的制度。最后,行政发包制所突出的人格化的责任分配(属地管理)和结果导向的控制,这并不是“行政分权”所必然包含的内容。

行政发包制作为一种治理类型也区别于经典的M型组织(Chandler,1966;Williamson,1975,1985)。Qian和Xu(1993)曾经使用M型结构描述中国改革前的经济结构,以此与苏联的U型结构进行比较。我认为,与M型组织比,行政发包制对应着更为松散、弱化的总部控制、层级更多的发包序列以及承包方更为广泛的事务管理。更进一步说,行政发包制是以层层发包代替了M型组织以专业化分工和一体化协调为特征的总部功能。通常的M型公司组织仍然存在一个强大的总部功能,如集中的投资功能、预算控制和战略规划(Williamson,1985)、统一的人事管理制度和标准,而行政发包制则是尽可能把各种相关事务整体发包下去,以最小化总部协调为目标。除了维持最重要的人事任命权和重大事项的决策权,最高发包方更像是一个控股公司。M型组织中的分权单位(如作为利润中心的子公司或地区分公司)仍然是一个相对集权的科层化管理,但行政发包制在分权单位内部可能仍然是发包式管理。在这方面,秦晓关于中国90年代国有集团公司治理结构的研究对于我们说明两者的区别很有帮助(秦晓,2010)。根据他的研究,中国国有企业集团治理与国外通行的M型结构的集团公司治理相比,有一个鲜明的特征就是总部功能弱化,从总公司到分公司再到孙公司,更像是一个层层发包的管理体制,秦晓称之为“纵向多级法人结构”。也就是说,中国国有企业集团作为一种准行政组织,其治理模式更接近于政府的行政发包制,而不是现代的M型组织。

关于国家的组织形态,政治学一般划分三种主要形式:单一制、联邦制和邦联制。学者通常将中国归之为单一制国家,因为中央政府是地方政府所有权力的授权来源,地方政府不享受地方自治的地位。Qian和Weingast(1997) 基于1980—1993年的行政分权和财政包干制的事实,提出中国在行政和财政体制上具有一些联邦制的特征,称之为“中国特色的联邦主义”体制。然而,从我们研究的角度看,单一制、联邦制或邦联制均不能准确概括中国政府间关系的核心特征,行政发包制可能是一个更为准确的描述。

中国在一些重要方面比世界上大多数单一制国家更集权,中央政府具有剩余控制权和无上的权威,立法权高度集中于全国人大,地方政府不享有地方自治的权力,中央对地方政府决策的否决权和干预权是不受任何制度约束的。在西方,即便是单一制国家,中央政府如果想让地方实现某个公共服务的目标和标准,通常的办法是给予地方政府相应的专项资金或转移支付,“中央请客,地方买单”的情况很少发生,或者由中央政府在地方的直属机构直接提供和实施。但在中国,如前所述,中央政府下达的任务和目标虽然近年来也有一定的专项资金和转移支付,但在大多数情况下,各级地方政府更多依靠自己的财力和资源去解决财源问题。

在另外一些方面,中国又比通常的联邦制国家还要分权和分散。中国的《立法法》将中央部委制定的法律条例与省级政府制定的法律条例放在相同的立法地位,极具中国特色。立法地位由立法者所对应的行政级别决定,而不是法律条例覆盖的地域范围决定。在美国联邦制的设计中,只要在联邦政府负责的跨区域事务中,联邦立法一定高于州立法,州法律如果与联邦法律发生抵触则以联邦法律为准。与此相联系,中国各地市场、监管和司法的地方保护主义长期盛行,屡禁不止。诸如美国联邦制的“州际贸易”(inter-state trade)条款和全国统一市场的法律约束在中国并不存在。中央部委面对同等甚至行政级别更高的地方政府,其横向协调和整合能力在很多领域是相对有限的,至少在常态下如此,更多依赖于地方政府之间的协调和合作。如环保部的“挂牌督办”在一些地方形同虚设,地方政府为招商引资出台各种环保“土政策”,如减半征收排污费,同时不让环保部门进行环保检查,简化环评手续检查等等;食品安全问题因政府“九龙治水”、地方保护主义而长期得不到解决;环渤海地区污染治理、京津冀一体化长期进展缓慢。

中国与西方单一制和联邦制国家的另一个重大区别是,虽然中央具有绝对权威和广泛的干预权,但中央财政支出占国家总财政支出的比例在过去30多年一直处于20%—30%的水平,近年来更是降至15%左右的历史新低,与西方发达国家通常在50%—60%的水平形成鲜明对比。我国中央政府对教育、医疗、环保和社会保障的财政支出占这些领域的总政府支出的比例与发达国家相比也长期处于非常低的水平。

上述中国政府间关系所呈现的独特现象,中央集权、地方分权和中央层面横向协调和整合度低三个特征,被称为中国政府治理的“集权—分权”悖论(周黎安,2008),这些都是单一制或联邦制所无法描述的,而正好与行政发包制的特征相一致。

首先,在组织内部统一的权威之下的发包赋予了发包方(委托人)不受约束的正式权力和剩余控制权,作为承包方的地方政府并不具备如联邦制国家州政府那样的独立主权或西方单一制国家的地方政府享有的自治权,自然也不享有与中央签约的平等地位和关系,这与中国政府的集权特征相一致。“中央请客,地方买单”的财政融资模式与行政发包制的财政分成激励是相对应的。

其次,以属地管理为特征的行政发包制又赋予了地方政府自由裁量权和实际控制权,这些正式和非正式的权力导致了在中央政策执行过程中的各种变通和抵触;层层整体发包又造成了各种形式的地方保护主义盛行。

再次,如前所述,属地层层发包将跨区域事务和全国性公共产品进行了人为的属地切割,全国性公共产品“肢解”为地方性公共产品;与此同时,发包层次越低,越是属地公共产品和服务的提供者,这导致了中央层面直接承担的公共支出比例低或者地方政府(尤其是基层政府)公共支出比例高,同时也是地区间公共服务差距大的根本性原因。[^44] 这一切都使得中央政府应该承担的跨地区横向协调和整合功能没有充分实现。[^45]

西方国家从20世纪80年代以来为了提高政府行政服务的效率和缩减成本,开始盛行“政府事务外包”(public sector outsourcing),政府事务外包主要是指将政府一部分职能或服务转包给私人机构,政府有权决定外包合同的主要内容(如质量标准,外包公司聘任和期限等)。行政发包制与西方国家的政府事务外包的区别在于前者是政府内部的发包,而不是外包给政府之外的独立主体,所以行政发包制不直接涉及政府活动的边界问题,而主要是内部治理模式的问题。

通过上述比较分析,我们可以更清楚地界定行政发包制相比科层制的最大区别:它是以层层整体性发包代替专业化分工和一体化协调,最小化总部协调功能,除了控制一些核心的权力(如人事权和干预权),发包方的常态治理是试图将跨地区的协调性和整合性功能维持到最低水平;它是以整体性问责代替各司其职,以承包方的无限责任代替代理人的有限责任,以结果考核代替过程和程序控制,以人格化问责代替职业主义要求。

韦伯的官僚制提供了一种分析的理想类型,但未揭示官僚制发生和变化的条件和内在运行机制。有关文献中对于中国政府治理特征的描述,如Landury(2008)、Xu(2011)提出的地区分权的权威体制,也有类似的问题。我们不仅提出行政发包制是一个理想类型,还揭示了它的发生条件,而它的三个维度的系统性和协同性则进一步指明了其内在的运行机制和组织逻辑,以及在外部冲击下可能的演变方向。

[[25]](#part07.html_filepos226719) 周庆智详细列举了W县2000—2001年政府机关和直属行政事业单位的主要经费来源。一个基本的结论是,财政拨款只占这些行政机关和事业单位公用经费的一部分,甚至很小的一部分,几乎所有的行政和事业单位都严重依赖于预算外资金的筹集,如行政性收费、罚没收入和营利性活动。比如该县的畜牧局按人头400元拨给的公用经费28000元,而据畜牧局局长自己的估计,畜牧局为了维持正常的运转,一年所需的办公经费达40万,所以财政拨款连一年的电话费都不够支付。一年40万的办公经费的筹集主要靠经营畜牧门诊、出租奶牛厂厂房、出租机关房屋和行政性收费等。像畜牧局这样的情况在该县其他许多科局也程度不同地存在,只有少数科局既无实权、又无收费项目,只能依靠财政拨款勉强维持(周庆智,2004,第190—191页)。

[[27]](#part07.html_filepos238677) 这些领域的省内垂直管理的改革在2008年之后又回到了属地管理。

[[28]](#part07.html_filepos241056) 这里说的行政发包程度主要是指决策权和执行权是更偏重于承包人还是发包人,预算分配更多是靠承包人自筹财源还是更多来自发包人的拨款,考核和评估更多是结果导向还是规则和过程导向。在大多数情况下,这三个维度会朝一个方向协同变化。

[[29]](#part07.html_filepos243469) 当我们讨论行政发包程度与范围的选择时,人们可能会发问:行政发包制在中国的形成与演变到底是统治者“自上而下”的理性选择还是基于历史、文化和组织实践的路径依赖和自然适应?这是一个很难回答的问题,应该两者都有。一方面,我们确实看到行政发包制在不同治理领域实施的程度差异,我们也看到中央对相关施政领域治理模式的一系列调整和改革,如海关、工商、质检、药品等领域的垂直化管理的改革,在有些领域甚至出现反复,如食品药品管理历经属地管理、垂直管理,最后又回到属地管理,这些都反映了决策者对治理模式的理性比较和选择,而非完全路径依赖和被动适应。在古代,一个新朝代建立之时,开国皇帝都通常会和他的僚臣一起认真总结历史上政治兴衰的规律,尤其是前一个朝代的统治得失。虽然大致承袭前一代的旧制是常见的情况,但提出重大制度调整和改革的情形也不乏见,如隋唐的科举制,元代的行省制等。显然这种承袭旧制或制度创新是一种非常有意识的决策行为。但是另一方面,中国的历史和文化的因素、长期的组织实践也确实影响着后来的行政治理特征的塑造。张静(2014)提到中国近代以来国家政权建设过程其实是行政吸纳代理的过程,即“地方权威的官僚化”(张仲礼,1991),就是一个很好的例子。组织的形成是理性选择还是自然适应的结果有时也难以完全分开。自然适应通常有特定的方向和路径,就像物种进化中的“自然选择”过程可以看作是朝着物种生存概率最大化的“理性”方向演进一样;理性选择也必须结合已有的组织资源和约束条件(包括历史遗产和人们的文化观念),不可能在一个抽象的世界里进行选择。

[[34]](#part07.html_filepos253124) 从委托人的角度看,科层制涉及的治理成本相对较高,如全额预算、有竞争力的人员薪酬和福利以及贯彻公平性和公众问责所必须确立和执行的繁复规则和程序。

[[35]](#part07.html_filepos258467) 经济学比较分析发包制与雇佣制的时候一般假定企业不面临任何信贷和资金的约束,因而只需考虑这些制度安排的效率性质。但对于行政组织来说,如何征税并使国家财政收入达到有效规模是一个巨大的挑战;事实上,这是西欧国家18世纪以来国家政权建设的核心内容(Tilly, 1975)。

# 3 转型中的地方分权

中国改革开放以来最重要的行政体制改革是中央行政和经济管理权力的下放和地方自主权的增强。中央向地方放权使地方政府从过去集中计划的体制束缚中解放出来,凭借其信息优势作出因地制宜的决策。更重要的是,在改革之初,中国的最高层对于未来的发展道路,其实并没有多少“顶层设计”和“宏伟蓝图”,主要采取“摸着石头过河”的实用策略。行政性放权就是这种实用策略的产物,结合以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛,赋予了地方探索改革和开放有效路径的巨大空间和强大激励。这种分散化的改革尝试有助于降低改革的整体性风险。但行政性分权也同时导致了一系列的问题,如宏观经济调控的困难、诸侯经济与地方保护主义问题等等。

本章重点考察的不仅仅是行政性分权的得失问题,我们更为关注的是中国政府间行政关系的一些独特性质,比如为什么新中国成立以来行政性放权会成为中国政府间关系调整的一个主旋律?同样是放权,改革前与改革后有何重要区别?行政性分权在中国的特定制度环境下采取了哪些独特路径?我们试图从中央和地方权力关系的持续调整和改革过程揭示行政发包制所蕴含的治理逻辑。

## 3.1 改革之前中央和地方关系

新中国成立之初实行了中央高度集权的行政与经济管理体制。从行政方面来看,中央拥有一切重大决策的权力以及对地方政府决策的最终否决权,而地方政府所拥有的行政权力均来自中央政府的授权。就这个意义而言,中央的权力是高度集中的。从国际比较的角度看,既便在单一制国家里,中国权力集中于中央的程度也是惊人的。中央高度集权的另一方面反映在人事权的高度集中。改革以前中央和地方推行“下管两级”的人事管理体制,中央负责省级和地市级领导干部的任免、提拔和调动。

就行政权力、人事权和立法权而言,中央和地方的关系在改革之前保持了高度的稳定性。与此相对照,中央和地方的经济关系却一直处于变化和调整之中,1953—1978年间经历了多次重大的经济权力的放收运动。这两者的鲜明对比绝不是偶然的,后面的分析将表明,行政方面权力分配的稳定性与经济权力的变动性之间有着必然的联系。下面我们将重点研究中央和地方经济关系的演变。

1950年3月,政务院颁布了《关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定》,具体规定了统一财政收支管理、统一物质调度、统一现金管理等内容。这标志了在战争时期共产党长期形成的各个作战区自给自足、分散管理的局面的结束。

然而,50年代初从苏联那里学来的中央高度集权的管理体制,使得地方难以发挥应有的主动性和积极性,地方领导对此抱怨很大,纷纷要求中央下放一些权力给地方。这促使毛泽东对苏联模式在中国的适用性进行了深刻的反思。他在1956年《论十大关系》的讲话中最终提出了要发挥中央和地方“两个积极性”的著名观点:“我们的国家这样大,人口这么多,情况这样复杂,有中央和地方两个积极性,比只有中央一个积极性好得多。我们不能像苏联那样,把什么都集中到中央,把地方卡得死死的,一点机动性也没有。”经过陈云的阐释和发展,毛泽东关于中央和地方两个积极性的重要观点进一步演变成对中央和地方经济权力的重新调整,给地方适度分权。[^1] 在此过程中贯彻的一个基本思路是,首先确保国家计划任务的完成,然后给地方下放一定的权力,包括计划指标权、财权以及企业的生产计划、人事、财务、劳动力等方面的管理权。1958年,新中国开始了历史上第一次大规模的改革高度集权的计划管理体制的尝试。

上述经济放权反映了毛泽东和其他中央领导反思苏联高度集权体制、结合中国的实际情况而进行的一次重要的制度改革,为后来的经济体制改革奠定了重要的思想基础,也提供了宝贵的实践经验。然而,非常不幸的是,1958年正是中国经济大跃进的高峰年,为了配合中央提出的“赶英超美”的总体经济发展战略,原本经过精心研究、反复论证的经济管理制度的改革设计很快演变成了一次仓促的权力下放运动。在工业管理体制方面,中央各主管工业部门,不论轻工业或者重工业部门,以及部分非工业部门所管理的企业,除了一些主要的、特殊的以及“试验田”性质的企业仍归中央继续管理以外,其余企业,原则上一律下放,归地方管理。按照这个要求,中央部门直接管理的1165个企事业单位,下放了885个。而且中央的通知规定,这些企事业单位的下放和交接完成必须在不到半个月的时间里完成。与此同时,中央向地方全面放权,包括计划决策权、基本建设项目审批权、物质分配权、财权和税收权、劳动人事管理权、信贷管理权等等。由于权力下放过猛,陈云所担心的“职权下放以后,地方也可能发生不顾全局的倾向”还是出现了。各地利用下放的权力大上基建项目,增加职工人数,平调国营企业的设备、材料,致使企业之间原有的生产协作关系被打乱,计划失控,工业生产陷入混乱。所以,从1959年3月开始,中央下放给地方的经济管理权(计划、基本建设、物质、财政和企业管理)陆续上收,一场浩浩荡荡的权力下放运动宣告结束。

中央预期到权力下放可能对原来的生产秩序带来的冲击,曾提出建立地区性的经济协作区,以尽可能谋求地区内的经济平衡和地区之间的协作。各协作区的主要任务是,组织区内的各省、直辖市、自治区保证完成或超额完成国家计划,并根据具体情况建立本协作区比较完整的工业体系。1958年8月中旬,毛泽东在视察天津工作时进一步提出:地方应该想办法建立独立的工业体系,首先是协作区,然后是许多省,只要有条件,都应想办法建立独立的但是情况不同的工业体系(赵德馨,1988,第525—526页)。由于主管经济协作区建设的协作委员会只是一个协调机构,解决不了地方各自为政的局面,经济协作区的想法最后也随着经济权力上收而被搁置下来。但必须指出的是,关于中国省区建立独立的工业体系的思想代表了毛泽东试图解决地方分权问题的一个理想模式,即地方分权必须与相互独立的省区经济相一致,以减少对中央计划协调的依赖。从1956年开始反思苏联模式的弊端和探索中国工业化的独特道路,毛泽东一直强调调动地方政府的积极性,对地方分权情有独钟。地方分权在后来的体制演变中反复被提上中央的议事日程,这绝不是偶然的。在许多政治学家看来,毛泽东善于利用地方和群众的积极性来对抗和制衡中央经济部门的官僚体制和保守性,是一种政治策略的体现。事实上,地方分权思想背后的逻辑也可以从它的经济和体制含义上去理解,后面我们将更深入讨论这一点。

1958年的混乱导致了1959—1960年的权力上收,重新回到高度集中的计划管理体制,经济进入调整时期。当经济刚刚恢复、步入正轨不久,1964年8月,毛泽东又提出了分权的想法。他在一次文件批示中指出:“计划工作方法,必须在今明两年内实行改变。如果不变,就只好取消现有计委,另立机构。”(房维中,1984,第382页)这导致了1965年一系列扩大地方权力的措施出台,包括扩大地方的计划管理权、基本建设权和物质分配权。

1966年2月,毛泽东在给刘少奇的一封信中说:“一切统一于中央,卡得死死的,不是好办法。”同一年他又提出“虚君共和”的主张,强调中央只管虚,只管政策方针,不管实、或少管点实。他批评中央部门对下放的工厂收多了,凡是收的都叫他们调出中央,到地方去,“连人带马”都出去。1967—1968年处于“文革”最混乱的时期,毛泽东关于地方放权的想法没有马上执行,直到1969—1970年才真正付诸实施。

1969—1970年开始的经济管理体制的调整是继1958年以来又一次大规模的放权运动,在放权思路和具体措施上与1958年的做法非常相似(汪海波,1998,第465—473页)。首先是下放企业的管理权限,要求绝大多数中央直属企业、事业单位下放给地方管理,而且企业下放必须在1970年内完成。经过这次下放,连同之前煤炭工业部先行下放的22个矿务局,中央部署企业(不含军工企业)一共只剩下142家,比1965年的10533家减少了98.6%,这些保留的中央企业的工业产值在全民所有制工业总产值的比重只占到8%左右(周太和,1984,第137、297页)。其次下放财权、基建投资权、物质分配权和计划管理权。在财政上实行“定收定支,收支包干”的制度。在基建方面,国家规定的基建任务,地方负责包干建设,投资、设备、材料均由地方统筹安排,结余归地方。从1974年起,基本建设投资改按“四、三、三”的比例分配,即基建投资额中的40%由中央主管部门掌握使用,30%由中央主管部门与地方共同安排,其余30%由地方自行掌握使用。中央还从1970年起每年拨出80亿元作为发展“五小”工业专项基金,交给各省、自治区、直辖市支配,以推动地方“五小”工业的发展。在物质管理方面,也实行物质分配大包干制度。国家统配和部管物质的种类大为减少,从1966年的579种减少到1972年以后的217种。由中央下放给地方管理的企业的物质分配和供应也交给地方负责。对部分重要物质试行“地区平衡,差额调拨”的办法,即在国家统一计划下,实行地区平衡、差额调拨、品种调剂、保证上缴的大包干制度。从1971年开始,水泥在全国范围内实行“地区平衡,差额调拨”,煤炭在20个省的范围内实行,其他重要物质,如钢材、纯碱等则从更小的省、直辖市范围内实行。在计划管理体制上,实行在中央统一领导下,自下而上、上下结合,“块块”为主,“条块”结合的管理体制。最后,在税制、信贷、劳动工资方面也做了一定的简化。

地方分权与自成体系、相互独立的省区经济可以相互兼容,而地方分权不可能与中央统一的经济计划相一致。1958年以来一直到1980年,中国经济管理体制经历数次“放权—收权”循环,宏观经济也围绕着权力收放而波动起伏,恰好说明了地方分权与中央计划之间的深刻矛盾。更关键的是,地方分权加上相互独立的省区经济,在经济管理上非常接近于一个属地化行政发包的体系。在此体系之下,地方领导人的责任可以更清晰地界定和落实,属地之间也容易发起晋升竞争,为层层动员的运动式经济跃进奠定必要的制度基础。而一旦进入中央垂直部门高度集权和统一管理的局面,中国传统行政体制所蕴涵的“活力”就被窒息了,企业也被束缚住了,经济就进入一种按部就班的慢步调,这显然无法满足毛泽东对经济跃进式发展的期望。自50年代中期开始,毛泽东系统反思中央垂直管理过于集中的弊端,批评经济计划的保守性,同时对地方和群众在经济发展中所体现的积极性倍加爱护;“大跃进”之后只要经济条件允许,就要求对地方放权,在一个看似统一严密的计划经济体制植入自成体系的经济协作区、相对独立的省区经济和层层分解的地方计划;这一切都反映了毛泽东对中国经济赶超道路的独特理解。在更深刻的制度层面上,高度集中的苏联模式与中国传统的属地化行政发包体制存在内在冲突,如果严格执行苏联模式,等于是用中国人最不擅长的管理方式与手段去推动一个越来越复杂和严密的经济体系。所以,我们所看到的是,作为舶来品的经济计划模式被赋予了强烈的中国特色,即以属地化的层层分解和省区经济的相对独立支持一个庞大的计划经济。在这个意义上,中国所执行的计划经济其实就是中国特色的行政发包制与苏联模式的结合体。

计划经济时期一次又一次的地方放权对中国经济结构产生了持续而深刻的影响。虽然存在若干轮收放循环,但每一次权力下放,不管最终如何回收权力,地方管理地方经济的权力都不可逆转地增加了,这最终奠定了中国经济M型结构的历史基础(Qian and Xu,1993)。

## 3.2 改革开放以来的地方分权

当“文化大革命”结束的时候,中国经济到了崩溃的边缘。1949年以来近三十年国民经济保持了大约6%的增长,但人均工资水平基本未变,人均住房面积甚至下降,基本消费品高度短缺。计划经济留下了一个僵化、低效率的体制结构。党的十一届三中全会之后,中国开始对高度集中的计划体制进行改革。改革的基本思路是“简政放权”。“简政”是指精简政府机构,大力撤并中央的一些部委。1982年底,国务院工作部门由1981年底100个减少到61个。“放权”是指中央对地方政府下放各种行政、立法和经济管理权力。[^2] “放权”无疑是最为关键和最有成效的改革策略。

1982年底第五届全国人民代表大会第五次会议通过了新的《中华人民共和国宪法》,即通称的《八二宪法》。相比以前的三部宪法,新宪法赋予了地方政府更为清晰和自主的行政管理权限和立法权限,也为后续的中央和地方政治关系的重大调整提供了宪法基础。在政治方面的调整主要包括以下几个方面:第一,在行政管理方面,地方政府的职权有所扩大。更为主要的是,相比以前的三部宪法,《八二宪法》第一次对各级地方政府的事权进行了较为明确的界定和列举,并强调在中央统一领导下,充分发挥地方的主动性和积极性。第二,在立法权限方面,确立了“全国人大—国务院—省级人大和政府—省级政府所在地地市和国务院批准的较大的市的人大和政府”四级立法体制,地方的立法权限得以扩大。在改革开放之前,地方各级权力机关和行政机关没有立法权限。《八二宪法》明确规定省级人民代表大会及其常务委员会在与宪法、法律、行政法规不相抵触的前提下,可以制定地方性法规。第三,在干部人事管理方面,中央下放和扩大地方政府的干部管理权限,由原来的“下管两级”体制转变为“下管一级”的管理体制,即中央负责管理中央各部委和地方各省市自治区一级的领导干部;省一级党委负责管理省级机关和地级市一级的领导干部;地方对中央部委和地方党委双重领导单位的干部,在任免方面也拥有一定的权力。从1988年开始,中央开始逐步试点实行国家公务员制度,1993年《国家公务员暂行条例》通过,国家公务员制度在中央部委一级试行(谢庆奎,1998,第85—89页)。

同样值得注意的是中央和地方经济关系的改革。首先是财权下放,中央与省级政府实行财政包干制,省级政府对于最终留给地方的财政收入具有充分的自主权加以支配;其次是向地方政府下放一系列经济管理的权限。这主要体现在基建计划的审批权、物价管理权、利用外资审批权、物质统配权等等。例如,原先完全集中于中央的基本建设计划的审批权有一部分下放给省级政府,大中型基建项目仍然由中央有关部门决定,但小型项目可由省级政府的计划部门在国家核定的范围内审定。中央原来直接管理的一些企业也被下放给地方政府管理。

上述权力下放是针对所有地方政府而言的统一的“松绑”措施。在放权的过程中,中央部委相对于计划时期而言是明显的利益受损者,因为所有这些“松绑”的权力原先都是属于中央部委掌控的,现在要把权力从这些部门手中分出去,肯定会遇上很大的阻力。即使撇开中央部委的改革阻力,大范围、全局性的放权也不可能走得很远,过去中国经济“一放就乱”的顽症一定让决策者记忆犹新。这可以解释为什么80年代初期行政性放权仍然是有限的,许多重大决策权和审批权仍然集中在中央部委,比如在下放基本建设计划的审批权时只给省级政府下放了小型项目的审批权。那么,在这种情况下,如何能够加大行政性分权和改革开放的步伐呢?

当时改革思路的一个重要创新就是对局部地区的倾斜和优惠政策,通过设立经济特区、经济技术开发区、沿海开放城市、计划单列市等等一系列特殊经济区域,实现地方分权的“局部突破”。这种对局部地区政策倾斜的做法体现了中国领导人推崇的“双轨制”和“增量改革”的政治智慧。

中国幅员广阔,各地发展条件千差万别,任何“一刀切”的政策虽然可以节省中央决策的成本,但肯定会因为忽略地区间的巨大差异而带来诸多问题。而怎样正视和利用地区间长期存在的差异性,让各个地区都有足够的激励参与改革和制度创新,提高经济发展水平,是摆在中国领导人面前的难题。邓小平在80年代初就明确表述过让一部分人和一部分地区先富起来的重要思想。根据不同群体和地区的条件和贡献赋予区别对待的政策,以谋求改革收益的最大化,这是倾斜式分权改革的思想基础。

1979年4月,邓小平在听取广东省主要领导同志汇报时提出:办一个特区,可以划出一个地方来,叫特区。过去陕甘宁就是特区嘛。中央没有钱,你们自己搞,杀出一条血路来(邓小平,1993,第239页)。根据邓小平的指示,中央批转了广东和福建省委关于在对外经济活动方面采取“特殊政策、灵活措施”的两个报告,鼓励这两个省的企业与香港、澳门发展贸易关系,并在深圳、珠海、汕头、厦门两市试办“出口特区”。1980年中央正式确定深圳、珠海、汕头和厦门四个“经济特区”。

在全国尚处于高度集中的计划经济体制的时候,广东和福建于1979年被中央给予了“特殊政策、灵活措施”。从广东省来说,除了在深圳、珠海、汕头试办经济特区外,“特殊政策、灵活措施”还包括以下主要内容:(1)计划体制以地方为主。广东可以按照国家经济建设的总方针和总政策,自主制定生产、基建、技改、财政、外贸、商品流通、劳动工资、科技、文教卫生等各项发展计划。与此相适应,广东省管理的企事业单位所需的物质调配、劳动力安排和工资决定等权力也划给了广东省政府。(2)扩大地方对外贸易的权限。原属于中央直接管理的广东省外贸分公司,改由广东省和总公司双重领导,承办口岸的进出口业务;其中广东商品的进出口部分,由省安排。按照产销结合、工贸结合、内外贸结合的原则,广东可以试办省属专业公司,统一经营管理生产和内外销业务。广东对于本省举办的加工装配、补偿贸易和合资经营等项目,凡不涉及国家综合平衡的,可以自行审批。这些措施实际上打破了中国建国以来高度集中的对外贸易体制,使地方政府可以参与管理进出口贸易的业务。(3)财政体制实行“划分收支,定额上交,五年不变”的包干办法。财政收入除中央直属企事业单位的收入和关税仍然归中央以外,其余收入均作为地方收入,财政支出也是如此,除中央直属企事业单位的支出仍然归中央以外,其余支出均作为地方支出。基本建设除了中央直属企事业单位的投资由中央安排外,其他基建投资均由省里自行安排。(4)在国家统一政策、规定和计划的安排下,给予广东省一定的金融方面的机动权。外汇收支由省制定计划,报中央备案,银行监督执行。外汇贷款和相应的人民币贷款划给广东一个额度,由省批准。广东可以自行设立投资公司,吸引侨商、外商投资,实行自借、自用、自还、自负盈亏的原则(许卓云,2004,第134—136页)。

广东和福建采取“特殊政策,灵活措施”势必与中央部委原有的政策、条例、规定发生冲突。当冲突出现时,广东和福建应该怎么办呢?1980年,由胡耀邦同志主持的中央书记处52次会议提出:“中央授权给广东省,对中央各部门的指令和要求采取灵活办法,适合的就执行,不适合的可以不执行或变通办理。”(许卓云,第134—136页)这实际上相当于给予了广东省“先行先试”的自由裁量权。从中我们不难看出,中央希冀通过局部地区的大胆放权来改革高度集中的计划体制,尝试杀出一条新路。在这种情况下,地方政府被赋予了改革开放的剩余控制权。在后来的改革开放过程中,越来越多的地方政府开始创造性地执行中央政策,“遇到绿灯大步走,遇到黄灯快步走,遇到红灯绕道走”。改革的相机决策权给了地方政府,鼓励地方政府进行制度创新,这是中国改革开放时期地方分权的重要维度,其意义远胜某些特定权限的下放。

在改革开放之初,时任广东省委第一书记的任仲夷把中央赋予广东的“特殊政策、灵活措施”概括为三句话,即“对外更加开放,对内更加放宽,对下更加放权”,其中所谓“对下更加放权”,就是赋予市、县、企业更多的计划权、投资建设权、对外经济贸易权、物价权等。中央给省级政府的放权促进了经济权力向省以下地方政府倾斜。

经济特区是中国改革开放的一个重大战略安排。国家给予了经济特区特殊倾斜的优惠政策(中国行政管理学会,2002,第445—446页)。以深圳特区为例,国家给予的优惠政策包括:(1)税收优惠;特区生产的产品出台免征关税,进口设备、原材料和日用生活用品(除烟酒等少数几种品种外),免征关税,特区企业只交纳15%的企业所得税,外商投资企业经营期在10年以上的,从获利年度起,享受2年全免、3年减半征收。(2)土地使用优惠。特区土地使用费低廉,使用年限长。(3)外汇管理优惠。特区内外商投资企业出口产品收汇和经营业务外汇,允许全部保留现汇,经营进出口业务的企业和以进养出的企业,可以保留部分现汇,结汇后的额定外汇允许使用。(4)出入境管理优惠。(5)银行信贷优惠。国家允许特区银行吸取存款用作贷款。银行信贷资金上级不调整,各银行存款全部由深圳留用。在信贷计划上,深圳特区单列,由中国人民银行单独审批。在特区可以设立外资金融机构,开放金融市场。(6)劳动用工优惠。外资企业的劳动用工,手续简便,费用低廉。(7)赋予特区政府较大的经济管理权,其项目审批权相当于省一级。对于不属于中央统一管理的工作,有权根据国家有关的法规、政策精神,结合自己的实际情况,灵活处置,大胆探索。在经济特区,我们再次看到了相机改革权的下放。

经济特区不仅被赋予了许多别的省区没有的倾斜性优惠政策,而且还被鼓励大胆进行经济体制改革的尝试,充分发挥改革试验区的作用。中国许多改革措施最早出现于经济特区,然后才推广到全国其他地区,比如率先改革基本建设体制,实行工程招标和施工承包;率先进行物价改革,逐步放开商品价格;率先改革劳动用工制度和工资制度,推行合同工制和浮动工资、结构工资制等等。1987年,深圳经济特区先后采用协商议标、公开招标投标、公开拍卖三种不同的方式进行转让土地使用权的改革试验。这一成功试验促成了1988年4月全国人大宪法修正案把“土地使用权可以依照法律的规定转让”正式列入宪法条文。中国城市的房地产市场的开放由此启动,土地使用权的转让逐渐成为城市财政的重要来源,从而彻底改变了地方政府对于土地和城市建设的理解。90年代“经营城市”和“再造城市”的运动也正是以土地使用权的有偿转让作为轴心轰轰烈烈展开的。[^3]

深圳特区在行政体制改革方面也走在全国的前面。随着深圳市场化和对外开放的迅猛发展,计划经济时期遗留下来的传统行政管理体制无法适应新的经济形势。经济特区授予深圳市进行大胆改革的“特权”,所以从80年代初开始就开展了一系列的行政体制改革,为后来全国范围的行政改革提供了宝贵经验,成为中国行政体制改革的窗口和试验场。1981年深圳特区第一次政府机构改革就撤销了经委、农办等委办局,将建筑、物资、粮食、外贸、商业、供销等专业经济管理部门转变为经济实体,把企业从政府的微观干预中彻底摆脱出来。在1984年机构改革中,深圳探索建立“大行业、大系统”的综合管理体系。市计委被改为市经济发展委员会,统管特区的经济和社会发展规划;设立工业发展委员会,统管工业发展和企业管理工作;把交通运输系统有关各局合并为一个运输局;把工业、贸易和引进外资等有关各局合并,成立经济发展局,建立“大经贸”管理体制;把农林牧副渔等农口各局合并,成立农业局,建立“大农业”的管理体制等等。这些改革和二十多年之后党的十七大提出的“大部制”改革有许多相似之处,是行政体制最终服务于市场经济发展的必然结果。在深圳特区建立初期,实行市政府对口管理各委办,各委办对口管理有关局的三级管理体制,在政府机构改革中,深圳特区明确市政府机构各委、办、局为同一个管理层级,分别直接对市政府负责,大大精简了行政管理层次,提高了行政效率。深圳对行政审批的改革也进行得比较早,新设企业凡是符合深圳市产业政策和有关规定的,可直接到工商部门核准登记,不需要层层审批。

经济特区的迅速成功让中央认识到区域经济改革与开放的重要性,1984年又进一步开放了大连、秦皇岛、天津、烟台、青岛、连云港、南通、上海、宁波、温州、福州、广州、湛江和北海14个沿海城市。这些沿海城市扩大开放,主要包括两方面的基本内容:一是扩大这些城市对外开展经济活动的权力,放宽其利用外资建设项目的审批权限;二是对那些来沿海开放城市投资办厂的外商、华侨、港澳台同胞及其企业给予税收上的各种优惠政策。

中央在批准开放14个沿海城市的同时,提出在这些城市可以建立经济技术开发区。1984—1985年中央先后批准大连、秦皇岛、天津、烟台、青岛、连云港、南通、宁波、福州、广州、湛江11个沿海开放城市兴建了经济技术开发区。1986年8月和1988年6月,又先后批准将上海的闵行、虹桥和漕河泾开发区列入经济技术开发区。1992年批准温州、昆山、营口、威海以及福建的融桥和东山经济技术开发区。经济技术开发区所享受的优惠政策,大致接近于经济特区,只是前者主要局限于城市的某个区域,而不是独立的行政区域,优惠政策的覆盖范围和优惠程度也有所差异。截至1992年,大连、秦皇岛、天津、烟台、青岛、连云港、南通、宁波、福州、广州、湛江、闵行、虹桥和漕河泾14个经济技术开发区累计批准外商投资项目1700个,外资协议投资额86.5亿美元,实际利用外资22.9亿美元,已投产开业的外商投资企业1400多家(中国行政管理学会,2002,第451页)。

1988年,海南省经济特区建立。海南经济特区除了享受其他4个经济特区的优惠政策外,还享受4个经济特区没有的更加优惠的政策。这主要包括:(1)海南岛上的某些矿产资源,报国家主管部门批准后,可以与外商实行合资、合作勘探开发;(2)海南国有土地使用权有偿转让或出租,一次签约期最长70年,期满后可申请续约;(3)外商投资于交通、能源和农业开发项目,所得税减免可以更加放宽;(4)进一步下放外资项目的审批权;(5)海南可以按照自借自还的原则,从海外直接筹措资金进行开发建设;(6)海南的国内企业和外商投资企业实行一样的税收优惠政策(中国行政管理学会,2002,第453页)。

根据中央的要求,海南在建立经济特区的同时,也成为全国省一级机构全面改革的试点单位,按照“小政府、大社会”的行政模式精简政府机构和转变政府职能。新建的海南省政府机构共设27个厅、6个直属局,比原广东省海南行政区下设机构减少了20个,人员编制减少了200人。整个省级党政机构比建省前的行政区和自治州的机构减少了80个,人员编制减少了近千人。在省以下则建立了省直接领导市、县的地方行政体制。

1990年,中央又决定开放和开发上海浦东,批准建立浦东经济开发区,在金融、税收、土地管理、投资审批、进出口等一系列方面实行经济技术开发区和某些经济特区的政策,赋予浦东特殊的经济管理权限。

需要注意的是,首先被赋予优惠政策和对外贸易自主权的地区并不是中国当时最富裕和最发达的地区,如上海,而是选择一些区位因素好、发展潜力大的地区作为改革试验区。这些地区即使改革失败,对中国经济的影响也是有限的。除了降低改革的风险和影响范围,还有一个考虑,就是在这些相对落后的地区实行改革试验,遇到的政治和体制阻力也是相对小的。比如在深圳和海南进行行政体制改革,不会触犯太多中央部门的利益。这是中国改革“双轨制”策略在地方分权改革上的杰出运用。[^4]

进入90年代后期,中国的地区倾斜政策开始转向中西部地区,以减少地区差异,实现共同富裕的战略目标。“西部大开发”、“振兴大东北”、“中部崛起”等地区发展战略相继提出。

2006年国务院正式批准天津滨海新区成为全国综合配套改革试验区,是继深圳经济特区、浦东新区之后,又一个带动区域发展的新的经济增长极。据媒体报道,广东、广西、四川、湖南、湖北、辽宁等省以不同方式运作,希望成为继上海浦东新区、天津滨海新区之后全国第三个综合配套改革试验区。上海浦东和天津滨海新区的经验表明,一旦成为综合配套改革试验区,在金融、土地、税收、财政等政策上获得诸多优惠,可以让中央向地区让渡部分职权,政策含金量很高。[^5]

2013年9月29日中国(上海)自由贸易试验区正式挂牌,这是中国应对全球贸易新格局,高标准、高规格对标国家贸易新规则(如TPP规则)[^6] 的重大举措。上海自贸试验区主要在几个方面先行先试:一是引入“权力清单”“责任清单”,改变政府审批和监管方式;二是进一步开放投资领域,实行负面清单(非明确禁止即开放)管理模式,减少准入限制;三是转变贸易发展方式,推进贸易便利化;四是推动金融开放创新,在人民币资本可兑换、金融市场利率市场化、人民币跨境使用等方面进行试点。上海自贸试验区的试点经验和不足经过仔细论证、系统总结之后开始逐渐在全国复制推广。2015年4月国务院批准建立广东、天津、福建自由贸易试验区。2016年8月,第三批自贸试验区获准成立,包括辽宁省、浙江省、河南省、湖北省、重庆市、四川省、陕西省。这些自贸试验区的试点内容各有侧重,为中国未来更全面接轨国际贸易新规则进行压力测试,探索应对之策,积累重要经验。

在80年代初开始的地方分权过程中,经济特区和经济技术开发区等特殊区域政策是一个极为重要的方面。与此同时,将一些地级市变成计划单列市、享受副省级待遇也成为行政性分权改革的重要组成部分。

城市作为国有工业的重要聚集地,在改革之前主要扮演为国家工业化提供资金积累的作用,城市本身的建设,包括基础设施的建设长期投入不足;城市作为工商业、金融、科技中心的综合作用也被长期抑制,发展严重滞后。从行政管理体制来说,城市受到省级政府的直接监督和控制,缺乏自主性,经济发展丧失了活力。从80年代初以来,中国政府推进经济改革的一个重要方面就是改革城市管理体制,发挥城市作为经济中心的聚集效应和辐射效应的作用。

1983年中国进行了计划单列市的改革。计划单列市是中国经济体制改革过程中出现的特殊现象,指的是某些城市享受省一级经济管理权限,在国家计划中实行单列的现象。1985年12月《国务院办公厅转发体改委、国家计委关于继续落实和完善七城市计划单列工作报告的通知》对计划单列市的权限进行了明确说明:计划单列市和省级计划单位一样,拥有省级经济管理权限,在国家计划中单列户头,其经济和社会发展各项计划全面单列,直接纳入全国计划综合平衡、统筹安排,并直接参加全国性的各种经济活动。具体地说,计划单列市拥有的重要权力包括省级外贸自主权、省级固定资产投资审批权限、省级外商投资审批权限、省级税收权限和省级财政预决算权等。因此,虽然计划单列市还受到中央政府的管理,但是实际上它拥有的自主权要比单列以前大得多,也可以说是省级权限下放给了城市。这意味着,这些城市在相当程度上不再受到省政府的经济计划和管理的束缚,而可以形成自己相对独立的经济发展战略。当然,计划单列市只获得了经济管理方面的省级待遇,在行政管理上仍然要受所在省管辖。

自1984年重庆计划单列开始,最多的时候存在14个计划单列市,它们是重庆、武汉、沈阳、大连、广州、哈尔滨、西安、青岛、宁波、厦门、深圳、南京、成都、长春;但是,从1994年开始,计划单列市在不断减少,目前仅剩大连、青岛、宁波、厦门、深圳5个计划单列市。计划单列市作为中国地方分权改革的一部分,非常有效地促进了被单列城市的经济发展和经济效率,这一点事实上获得了系统的经验证据的支持(史宇鹏、周黎安,2007)。

计划单列市的出现有其特定的历史背景。一个直接的原因是,在传统的中央—省—城市的管理体制下,城市的经济效率受到严重压抑,城市官员对这种体制非常不满。从计划单列的名单上我们可以看出,这些城市往往具有较好的技术和人力资本禀赋,具有很大的增长潜力。但是主管城市的省政府考虑的不仅仅是经济效率,还要包括省内城市间的经济平衡。以大连市为例,计划单列以前,城市缺乏统筹安排全市经济、科技和社会发展的权限,经济发展受辽宁省综合平衡的严重制约。大连市的各方面计划要综合上报到辽宁省,在省批准计划下达之后,市计委再简单分配一下指标,下达到市属企事业单位和各县区执行。市计委在分配和执行省计划过程中,没有任何财力、物力等平衡的手段。这种权力配置的方式使得大连市这样一个工业门类齐全、交通运输发达、商业贸易活跃、信息灵通便捷的沿海大城市,能量不能完全释放出来,经济发展缓慢,缺乏活力。

在刚刚经历了“文革”的改革初期,中央财政状况非常困难。把省级经济管理权限直接下放给城市,把城市的财政和税收直接纳入国家计划,不仅可以加强对城市官员的激励,也可以为缓解财政紧张做贡献。因此,从中央政府的角度来说,它也有积极性对部分城市实行计划单列。但是最终被列入计划单列的城市并不多,而且最后也大部分被取消了。之所以出现这个结果,有其内在的原因。首先,中央政府需要维护省政府的权威和地方经济的平衡。由于计划单列使得省政府所掌控的财政资源大大减少,因此省级政府是城市计划单列的最大受损者,它们对计划单列颇有不满。失去一个大城市可能使一个省从财政收入结余省变成赤字省,如湖北省和四川省所发生的情况那样(黄佩华,2003,第78页)。

另一个取消计划单列的重要原因是,财政和税收体制从1994年起发生了重大变化。分税制开始全面实施,国家和地方财权的明晰程度前所未有,中央财政在财政总收入中的比重不断上升。在财政得到充分保障的情况下,国家没有必要再对这么多城市进行单列。大部分的计划单列城市在1994年都被取消了,仅仅保留了5个非省会的计划单列市,出发点可能仅仅是为了保障这些非省会城市的经济地位,防止省政府对这些城市“鞭打快牛”。

1983年与计划单列市改革同时进行的还有“市管县”的改革,实行地市合并、撤地设市和撤县设市,以进一步发挥城市的经济辐射作用,推动城乡一体化进程。

如何理解和评价这些地区放权和地区倾斜政策?学术界比较有影响的观点认为,向地区的“放权让利”政策被认为导致了“诸侯经济”的兴起(沈立人、戴园晨,1990)。在计划体制下,沿海地区主要发展加工业,内陆地区则以自然资源开采和初级产品的加工为主,这种区域分工的体系在计划体制下并没有形成太大的问题,因为中央决定产品价格,资源产品价格偏低,加工产品的价格偏高,国家通过沿海发达地区的加工业的利润上缴获得财政收入,以此补贴内陆地区。但在“放权让利”之后,各个地区被赋予了一定的经济自主权,如基建项目的审批权和投资权,以及对企业的管理权。在改革初期,主要产品的价格还是由中央决定,但是地方政府在“财政包干制”下对财税已经非常敏感。在这种情况下,内陆以初级产品为主的省份已不愿意以低的计划价格把初级产品交给沿海地区加工,让沿海地区坐享高额的工业利润和税收,而愿意自己建立企业,直接加工初级产品,“肥水不流外人田”。于是在80年代和90年代出现了严重的地区封锁和地方保护主义现象。

倾斜性的地区放权政策也引发了人们对于改革公平性的讨论。被政策倾斜的地区(如广东、福建)无疑获得了许多其他地区没有的优惠政策和中央财政资金的支持,发展迅速;而有些地区(如上海)向中央贡献的税收多,但一直受到各项政策的限制而发展缓慢。有统计表明,1987年,上海地方财政收入为172.91亿元,上缴中央119.82亿元,地方财政支出只有53.85亿元;江苏省地方财政收入为107亿元,上缴60多亿元,地方财政支出不足40亿元;而广东只上缴14亿元,地方留成达80亿元(谢庆奎等,1998,第75页)。

为什么中央能够如此“偏心”地“差别对待”各个地区?如果没有得到优惠的地区觉得这样不公平而消极怠工,即使被优惠地区有足够的激励发展经济,那中央总体的得益将仍然是有限的。地方分权的倾斜性取向有一个关键性的条件,那就是中央可以利用其手中对地方官员的人事任命权和地方官员的晋升激励,最大限度地减少倾斜性政策可能带来的消极后果。首先,只要地方官员的晋升竞争的基准组根据各个地区所面临的经济发展条件和中央的倾斜政策等因素而相应确定,使得每个地方官员尽可能面临一个公平的“官场竞争”环境,地方官员的抱怨和泄气心态就减少很多。因为这样一来,被倾斜的地区中央的预期也高,地方官员面临的压力其实也相应很高,而被冷落的地区中央的预期有限,地方官员反而可以制造一些“惊奇”,最后可能是公平的晋升竞争。周黎安等(2005)的研究事实上揭示了在省级领导的晋升竞争中,中央确实是理性地考虑了各个地区的特殊情况,使用了每个地区合适的参照组(如省级领导的直接前任的平均经济增长绩效或周边邻近地区的绩效)作为基准,决定地方官员的升迁概率。其次,省级领导干部的升迁和平行流动也有助于打破地方官员对某一个特定地区的利益关联,使得他们不至于过于“计较”某个特定地区特定时期的经济“得失”。被倾斜地区的地方官员可能流动到非倾斜地区,非倾斜地区的领导也可能流动或升迁到倾斜地区,考虑到这一点,也许就不至于彻底消极懈怠。所以,地方官员的地域流动性和官场流动性(晋升激励)是打破固化的地域利益格局的重要力量,被中央用来支持倾斜性的地方分权政策,抵消“政策不公”可能导致的懈怠甚至放弃的心态,这是中国行政治理体制的独特优势。

## 3.3 条块关系与项目制分析

中国地方政府的一个独具特色的方面是所谓“条块结合”的治理结构,即“条条”与“块块”相互交叉和相互制衡的结构。这里的“条条”通常是指中央一级的行政机关或企事业单位在不同层级的地方政府垂直设置的职能部门,例如国家税务总局、中国人民银行在各级地方政府设立的下属分支机构;“块块”是指地方政府所统辖和管理的部门与机构。在任何一级地方政府的部门结构中,既有“条条”部门,又有“块块”部门,两者是相互交织在一起。“条块关系”是“条条”部门和“块块”部门之间可能存在的各种关系的总称,它呈现出一个矩阵式纵横交错的组织结构,构成中国当代政府尤其是地方政府结构的一个最基本的特征。在纵向方面,从中央、省市自治区、市一直到县乡五个层级,每个层级又细分为若干个内部层级,形成一个严格的自上而下的金字塔式的等级结构。在横向方面,每级政府又分为综合部门(如国务院办公厅)和相关职能部门,每个部门又和上级、下级同类部门形成垂直“对口管理”关系。

条块结合使得地方政府及其职能部门处于一种复杂和微妙的权力关系当中。一级地方政府不仅直接接受上一级政府党委的监督和领导,它所管辖的各个政府职能部门也同时受到上级“条条”部门的监督和指导。也就是说,地方政府面临的是中央或上级政府的双重领导,而一个具体的地方政府职能部门也同时面对同级地方政府和上级条条部门的双重领导,对两个“婆婆”负责。在这个意义上说,中国的行政权力结构具有“分割的威权主义”(fragmented authoritarianism)的特点(Lieberthal and Lampton,1992)。分割的权力所体现的是“你中有我,我中有你”和“谁也离不开对方”,相互依赖同时又相互牵制。在条块关系中,我们需要区分所谓的部门之间的“领导关系”和“业务指导”关系。前者强调的是行政隶属和人事控制,后者不涉及人事任命,更多是业务的安排、监督和指导方面的关系。

同样是“条条”部门,它们与“块块”的结合程度依部门的性质而不尽相同。有一类是严格意义上的中央“条条”部门,如分税制改革之后的关税、国税和银行部门,属于中央垂直管理部门,这些部门的预算经费、人员、干部任免均由中央部门提供和决定,与地方政府没有直接的联系;第二类是省内“条条”部门,即所谓的省内垂直部门,如质检、工商、国土部门,这些部门的人员和财务由省级政府提供,相对省以下地方政府是独立的;第三类是形式上的“条条”部门,但“块块”色彩浓厚,如教育局、民政局、农业局等,这些部门接受上级对口部门的业务指导,但人员编制、经费预算、干部任命均由同级地方政府管理。

可以想见,这种纵横交错的条块关系会给中国地方政府的职能行使和行为方式带来重要的影响。从积极方面看,条块结合反映了中国特色的权力制衡和利益协调。在中国集权的行政体制下,下级政府作为代理人能否真正实行和贯彻上级政府的指示和意图,主要取决于上级政府的监督和制约。赋予地方政府的权力越多,中央对地方“失控”的危险就越大。中央一级的大政方针和对地方政府工作的监督和指导通过各个条条部门的上下贯通来综合实现,这体现了中央对地方可能出现的决策偏离进行全方位监督、制约和制衡的考虑。

中央对地方政府的垂直监督和制约必须要有一个限度,不能走得太远。如果条条部门完全独立于地方政府的管辖和影响,那就会出现两个不利的后果:一是条条部门可能会不重视它们对于地方社会经济事务的贡献,而与当地政府的利益发生冲突;二是条条部门如果失去了地方政府的财力、人力和物力的支持和配合,也难以在地方有效开展工作。所以为了让条条部门尽可能服务于所在地区,促进当地经济发展和社会进步,增加条块部门的合作,条条部门也程度不同地受到所在地政府的管辖和制约。尤其值得注意的是,在条块管理的模式下,中国的领导决策体制又强调“一元化”领导,即一级地方政府的权力集中于地方党委,地方党委集中于常务会和党委书记。采取“一元化”领导的方式在条块分割的结构中便于保证地方政府权力的完整性,从而维护和促进地方的整体利益。

中国行政管理的条块结构在改革的过程中孕育了不同的改革利益,这最终决定了中央领导人改革策略的选择。中央计划经济的权力主要集中于中央的条条部门,而地方政府处于相对弱势的地位。改革开放所涉及的核心问题就是如何把集中于计划管理部门(即中央条条部门)的权力逐步下放给地方政府(块块部门),如何减少计划管理部门对经济的支配和干预,使之逐渐缩小乃至消失,而这势必会遇到中央条条部门的重重阻力。为了获得对于改革的支持力量,邓小平时代的改革策略是向地方政府放权,让地方政府成为改革的最大受益者和坚强的支持者,然后利用地方政府的巨大支持来迫使中央计划管理部门对改革让步,达到改革中央计划部门的最终目的(Shirk,1993)。

从消极方面看,纵横交错的条块结构也给政府的运行带来许多问题。李侃如(Lieberthal,2002,pp.199—205)把中国政府结构的条块关系导致的问题进行了概括和分析,有以下三个方面的问题:

第一,上层领导的超负荷(overload at the top)和政府部门间的相互扯皮和推诿。由于权力分割在各个部门,批准一个项目需要涉及多个条条部门以及地方政府,如果遇到部门间冲突,政府部门间的相互扯皮和推诿就经常出现,最后就必须依赖更高层级的政府来进行协调和决策。所以经常出现一些小事都必须等待高层领导批示的情形,重要和棘手的决策就更不用说了。这是为什么中国政府处理什么事情都要由权力机构召集相关部门开会讨论和协调,离开了会议就很难处理问题。政府部门需要花费大量的时间(即广为诟病的“文山会海”)来达成政府部门间的共识和相互妥协。

上级政府的超负荷与我们经常听到的一句话“有事找市长”是一致的。为什么有事不去找相关部门而非要直接找市长呢?通常的情况是,一件事的受理和解决涉及多个政府部门,一个部门不能全权处理。如果处理这件事情对部门有利,就会出现各部门群起争夺管辖权的局面,如果没有好处在里面,相关部门则采取“踢皮球”的态度。最后只有让市长出面协调,“摆平”各方,才有可能加以处理。上级政府的超负荷问题除了条块分割的原因之外,还有一个原因就是下级官员的策略性行为,当下级觉得事情处理比较棘手时,就会倾向于往上推,向上级请示和汇报,以规避责任和风险,造成“大事不汇报,小事天天送”的局面。

第二,信息失真(lack of accurate information)问题。中国的政府体制涉及多个层级,同时又缺乏独立的信息渠道(如独立客观的新闻媒体),上级政府需要的信息必须依靠下级政府的汇报,这势必造成下级政府在披露信息方面的策略行为,信息扭曲和失真随之产生。信息传递的中间层级越多,信息失真问题就越严重。所以,对决策高层来说,如何及时获得高质量的真实信息就变得非常关键。民主集中制是中国共产党长期以来推行的决策机制,在形成最后的决策之前广泛征求各方的意见,鼓励大家畅所欲言,最大限度地让相关信息披露出来。前面说到中国各级政府喜欢举行各种工作会议,除了协商和协调各方利益之外,还有一个重要功能是广泛收集来自各方面的相关信息,便于在决策之前占有足够信息。近年来,新闻媒体和互联网也逐渐成为上级政府获得有关信息的重要渠道。

关于中国地方官员虚报数字的行为,李侃如披露了一个有趣的细节:在1971年中美关系解冻不久,中国政府曾向华盛顿求助,希望提供美国卫星拍摄的关于中国耕地总面积的数据。美国政府把这些数据给了中国政府。这些数据显示,由地方官员报上来的耕地总面积比实际面积低了20%。地方官员隐瞒耕地面积的问题曾经非常普遍。1997年中国官方公布的数据表明,中国的耕地面积在9000万公顷左右,而美国政府同一时期的研究表明,中国实际的耕地面积在1.45亿公顷左右(Lieberthal,2002,pp. 192—193)。

第三,官员的约束不力、腐败和专断(indiscipline,corruption and petty dictatorship)。这主要源于行政部门和单位领导的巨大自由裁量权,这种权力受到的监督和约束比较有限,因此给一些权力的拥有者随意作为留下了空间,独断专行和贪污受贿就是其表现之一。

在计划经济时期,条块结合的管理体制导致了行政隶属关系对经济活动和资源配置的切割,造成所谓的“地区封锁、部门分割”的后果。我们可以从改革之初中国的机械工业看出中国的工业体系是如何呈现部门林立、管理分算的局面。据统计,在90年代末,全国各类机械工业企业一共10.4万个(其中大中型企业1.2万个,小型企业9.2万个),分属工交和国防两个系统,从中央到省、市、自治区都有两套机构。在工交口中,又有一机、农机两个专业机械制造部和30多个中央部的专业机械制造局。国防口有从二机部到八机部等7个专业机械制造部,各地方还拥有自己的机械工业部门。民用一套,军工一套,中央一套,地方一套。各自自成体系,相互割裂,互相封锁(中共中央党史研究室第三研究部,2005,第91页)。

自从20世纪80年代的行政性分权以来,随着越来越多的经济管理权限下放给地方政府和企业,市场经济的迅速发展导致计划调控的力量日渐衰微,在传统上代表中央计划控制的条条部门的权力逐渐减少,“块块”的作用和地位逐渐上升。改革以来进行的几次重要的国家机构改革,均是以撤并和精简一些国家部委和工作部门为主要内容。1998年机构改革撤销了11个部委,从原来的40个部委减少到29个,传统上的煤炭部、电力部、冶金部、机械部等被取消。2003年国资委的成立,计划经济时期在工业生产方面所呈现的条块管理制度已经基本消失了。条块管理逐渐集中在在行政管理、宏观经济调控和政府监管方面。

但是,从1994年分税制改革设立国税局以来,中国行政管理体制的条块管理的结构开始发生一些重要变化。鉴于1992—1993年中国金融秩序的混乱,中央在1997年决定对中央银行以及商业银行实行垂直管理,地方政府对金融系统的干预权力被取消了。1998年,中国人民银行的省级分行被撤销,实行了跨行政区的大区管理体制,使中央的货币政策得以摆脱地方政府的行政干预。过去由于地方政府可以直接影响银行信贷量,各地为了追求经济增长的高速发展,一味要求银行放贷,导致经济过热,1993—1996年的严重的通货膨胀就是一个突出的例子。后来的银监会、证监会、保监会模仿银行系统采用了垂直管理的模式。

为了打破地方保护主义,为市场竞争提供一个公平的环境,1998年,国家决定对省以下工商行政管理机关实行垂直管理;在经费方面,省级工商行政管理局按照收支两条线的原则,对省区范围内的工商管理系统的财务经费实行统一管理,省级以下工商行政管理机构实行人事、组织、经费等垂直领导。2000年,质量技术监督部门和国家药监局也仿效了这个模式,建立省以下垂直管理体制。

长期以来,中国的统计管理制度实行统一领导、分级负责的原则,GDP核算也实施分级核算制度,国家统计局核算全国的GDP,各地统计局核算自己这一级的GDP。实际上,统计职能被层层分解和分包给了各级地方政府。这样一来,GDP和其他相关数据受地方政府绩效冲动的影响而经常失真。一个大家经常援引的例子是,国家公布的GDP增长率和各省市区公布的GDP增长率存在系统的差别,后者比前者一般高出3—9个百分点。围绕着GDP增长而展开的晋升竞争使得一些地方官员把注意力放在数据造假上,致使民间流传着“数字出官,官出数字”的说法。GDP数字的扭曲不仅导致官员晋升过程的不公平性,还妨碍了国家对宏观经济形势的准确判断和即时调控。国家统计局自2004年以来开启了一系列的改革。首先,从2004年开始,地方GDP核算之后,需要与国家统计局联合审查,并经过后者许可之后各地才能发布相关的统计数据。其次,2004年3月,国家统计局对各级调查队实行垂直管理,使之成为国家统计局的派出机构,承担国家统计局布置的各项调查任务,向国家统计局独立上报调查结果。2006年初,原属各省、自治区、直辖市的三大调查队和新疆生产建设兵团社会经济调查队,合并成为国家统计局各地方调查总队。北京、浙江等地实施了GDP核算下算一级的改革,即省级统计局核算地市的GDP,地市核算县的GDP。[^7] 2014年底,时任国家统计局局长的马建堂提出要加快推进GDP统一核算改革,按照这个设想,以后国家统计局统一核算和发布各地的GDP,地方GDP总和大于全国GDP的问题有望彻底解决。

2006年,国家对省以下土地部门实行垂直管理,将省以下的土地审批权限、国土部门的人事权限统一集中到省级国土部门。在原有国土资源分级管理体制下,土地规划、土地审批、土地出让金收取等权力实际上属于地方政府。据国土资源部披露,目前全国80%的违法用地是地方政府行为。2003年上半年,全国各类土地违法行为超过10万起,涉及土地面积39133公顷。中国几乎每次土地管理大的变动都与圈地浪潮和房地产膨胀相关。20世纪90年代初,中国实行土地有偿使用制度改革其实是一次大规模放权。之后,城市土地的各项权力实际上等于界定给了地方政府。按照原有地土地管理规定,省、市、县每级政府都有自己的批地限额。

土地管理垂直到省,意味着将市、县、乡的土地审批权力悉数上收。原来由地方政府任命的土地部门负责人,现在变成了由省级土地部门垂直任命,这一系列权力调整主要在于制止过去长时间以来市、县、乡各级的擅自审批、越权审批的乱批土地行为。虽然以前中央一直对用地实行宏观调控,但真正的操作权却在县、乡一级政府手里。他们可以修改土地规划,甚至把基本农田修改为建设用地。而修改后的规划只要报请省里批准就可以了,有的甚至委托地市审批。之所以造成这种状况,不是地方国土资源部门管理的缺位,而是因为地方国土资源部门职能太弱、管理权太分散,最后不得不充当了领导意志的执行者。

垂直化运动能否收到预期的效果还需要进一步观察。垂直管理并不能完全摆脱地方干扰。尽管垂直管理后部门的人、财、物不受制于地方,地方政府对垂直部门的影响或多或少地存在,比如当地部门在土地、水电、职工子女入学等方面也必须依赖当地政府,由于当地部门的人员主要来自当地,传统的关系网络也会发挥作用。垂直部门在地方实施监管,也必须得到地方政府相关部门的配合和支持,如公安、司法,从而受到一定的牵制。虽然垂直管理部门在人财物上不依赖于地方政府,但如果与地方利益冲突太大,地方政府还可以动用司法、公安、审计、监察部门的力量“骚扰”垂直部门的领导和工作人员,比如检查违法乱纪行为。这些潜在的威胁手段将制约垂直部门在地方“块块”的行为。

更重要的是,在当前的政治锦标赛的激励之下,地方政府以地方经济发展为第一要务,积极对外招商,调动地方一切资源(包括土地审批、工商、税务、银行、司法、公安、环保、安全生产)为企业提供实质性的支持,事实上这是一种以“块块”为单位横向整合许多属于“条条”管理的资源的方式。而一系列垂直化收权等于大大限制了地方政府横向整合资源的能力,这势必导致当前主要的官员激励方式——政治锦标赛模式与垂直化收权之间的潜在冲突。换句话说,传统的属地化行政发包的制度与政治锦标赛之间是高度互补、相互强化的制度安排,当前的垂直管理的改革旨在打破属地化管理的束缚,弱化垂直部门与当地的联系,实际上也就相应地削弱了政治锦标赛的执行基础。

如何在理论上解析中国独具特色的条块管理体制及其影响一直以来是一个重大的理论挑战。接下来,我们试图将行政发包制理论做进一步拓展,提出分析中国条块关系的观察视角和方法,并结合分税制以来盛行的项目制现象做一些分析。

第2章描述的行政发包制理论侧重于考察中国的“块块”关系,且只考虑一个委托人,即中央政府作为一个整体向各级地方政府分包各项事务和发号施令。在现实的条块关系中,从作为承包方的地方政府来看,有多个委托人,各个中央部委都向地方政府下达任务和指标。地方政府不仅面对多个委托人,还承担多项任务(各任务之间也可能有冲突),是一种多委托人、多任务的代理问题(multi-principals,multitasking agency)。这里既有整体(块块)承包和考核,又有单项(条块、条条)承包和考核,两者存在重叠、互动和冲突。同时,从一个委托人(某中央部委)的视角看,又有众多的承包方(地方政府)。

将行政发包制理论拓展至多个委托人和多个承包方的情形可以有助于打开中国独具特色的条块关系的黑箱,揭示一系列与条块关系有关的有趣现象。从“块块”关系延伸到“条块”关系,从行政发包制的角度看,最重要的变化是发包方的行政权配置不一样,发包方不再拥有对承包方的人事任命权,双方不是简单的上下级统属关系,而经常处于相同的行政级别(比如地级市环保局与县政府都属于处级单位),甚至发包方的行政级别还低于承包方(如环保部与直辖市政府),由此使得发包方控制和影响承包方的方式发生实质性变化。比如在纵向的“块块”关系中“上级请客,下级买单”的情况非常普遍,然而如果进入“条块”关系中,比如省条条部门想让市政府(或对应的市政府条条部门)执行某项政策,就必须寻找合适的影响和激励方式。条条部门通常有三种方式影响和推动地方政府:一是说服同级地方政府将此项政策纳入工作目标,如省委或省政府发文,最好是两者联合发文,将这项政策提升为省政府的工作目标,市政府必须做出响应;二是提供专项项目资金,通过资金分配来吸引地方政府参与和执行政策,响应积极、配合力度大的地方政府分配的资金多,反应冷淡、配合不力的地方政府资金分配少;三是组织各式各样的达标评比活动,向下级政府提供奖惩激励,尤其是给专项政策领域表现不力、排名靠后的地方政府施加压力。总之,缺乏人事任命权的支撑,上级条条部门单靠一纸文件是很难获得地方政府积极响应的,必须调动各种手段和资源,有时甚至是人脉关系。

中国政府的条块关系所呈现的一些有趣的结构性特征,为我们深入分析条块关系的运行机制及其背后的逻辑提供了一个简明的分析起点。下面我们分别从发包方和承包方的视角揭示条块关系的结构性特征及其影响。

3.3.1 “多对一”与“一对多”:发包方的角度

“多对一”是指多个发包方(中央部委)面对一个承办方(地方政府)。在这种格局中,发包方的关系是既分工合作又相互竞争。一方面,各中央部委是分工合作的关系,在职责上各管一块,一个部委要推动本部门的工作必须得到相关部委的协助和支持。比如工业信息化部要推动中国信息化产业的发展,需要有国家发改委、财政部、科技部等相关部门在规划、审批、资金、科技政策等方面的支持。另一方面,中央部委之间职责上有重叠,资源上有约束,工作上有考核,中央部委之间也存在一定的竞争关系:给定中共中央和国务院的方针政策,如何吸引地方政府的资源和注意力实现本部门的政策目标就成为关键性的挑战。如果每个部委在地方上都有自己的“腿”(即直属部门),部委间的竞争性约束就不那么严重。但中国层层分包体制出现的情况是“上面千条线,下面一根针”,这意味着多个部委面对同一个地方政府,同时又不能对后者行使人事任免权,只能进行“业务指导”,如何让地方政府贯彻其政策意图,一条线如何在多线穿针的情况下力争占据重要位置,就是一个巨大的挑战。

但是,一个中央部委也同时面临多个地方政府,即“一对多”的关系。作为发包方的中央部委显然会利用“一对多”的关系发动地方政府之间的竞争,以更好地实现其政策目标。因为发包方不控制承包方的人事任命权,所以这种竞争不是政治锦标赛,而是标尺竞争。[^8] 这是条条部门影响地方政府和下级条条部门的重要方式,这也解释了为什么条条部门非常热衷于举办各种各样的评比达标活动。

从发包方“多对一”和“一对多”的观察视角,我们可以对近年来非常时兴的项目制做一些分析。项目制在分税制改革之后逐渐流行,它是指中央或上级政府在常规的财政体制和管理体制之外以专项资金的方式贯彻政策意图、实现转移支付和进行资源配置的一种制度形式。关于项目制的国家治理特征以及引发的经济和社会后果,社会学的一些文献已经做了一些系统和深入的解析(折晓叶、陈婴婴,2011;周飞舟,2012;渠敬东,2012);周雪光(2015)从“控制权”理论的视角对项目制的研究文献进一步做了梳理,总结了项目制的核心特征及其所对应的组织形态。中央部委安排的专项资金不纳入各级地方政府的财政体系,具有“体制外循环”的特征,在再分配过程中随意性较大(周飞舟,2012)。在一个上下级的多层级政府体系里,项目制强化了地方政府动员型治理的倾向,游离于政府常规体制之外,其运行机制与科层制逻辑很不一样(周雪光,2015)。体制外循环、因事而设的随意性和动员型治理,这些特征在一个多层级政府体系里发生,让我们看到了项目制浓厚的行政发包色彩。

然而,关于项目制的治理特征仍然值得进一步分析。比如上述从发包方视角所强调的“多对一”和“一对多”的结构性特征,说明“项目制”运作的一个重要驱动因素是发包方之间的隐性竞争(“多对一”的结果),而发包方的竞争又引发了承包方之间的竞争(“一对多”的结果)。在中央部委既分工协作又相互竞争的关系中,项目制契合了中央部委的两个基本要求:第一,在相互协作的工作体系中需要识别特定部委的工作绩效和贡献;每个项目都有具体的政策目标和招标单位,自然便于判断项目的发包方身份和资金投入量的规模。第二,尽最大可能让地方政府在有限的资源中分配出更多份额服务本部门的政策目标。这有助于解释为什么项目制要求地方配套资金和招标竞争,因为这便于从地方政府有限的资源中挤出有利于特定发包方的份额。

从发包方竞争的角度也可以更好地理解项目制的配置效率问题。各部委为响应中央号召(如新农村建设),一般会竞相推出各种专项资金项目,各部委之间通常缺乏必要的协调,这势必导致项目和资金在一个地方上显得过多过杂,即所谓的“撒胡椒面”。中央部委的竞争可能是中央层面缺乏充分的协调整合的一个重要原因。[^9]

分税制之前因中央财政收入比重大幅下降而难以提供较多的专项转移资金,分税制之后中央财政收入大幅上升,地区间的发展差异又需要大量的中央转移支付。有统计表明,专项转移支付占全部转移支付的比例从1995年的16%,增加至2005年的三分之一,至2012年进一步增加到42%(周飞舟,2012;史普源,2014)。中央财政收入的大幅增加和地区差异扩大显然是项目制实施的一个重要条件,但是采取项目制的特定形式完成专项转移支付不是必然选择,比如为了实现地区公共服务的均等化可以增加一般性转移支付的比重,专项转移支付比例的不断上升与我们强调的“多对一”和“一对多”的格局有很大关联。

3.3.2 “多对一”和“一对多”:承包方的角度

站在地方政府的角度看,条块关系也呈现“多对一”和“一对多”的格局。“多对一”是指多个地方政府面临一个上级条条部门,这与站在发包方视角看到的“一对多”相对应;“一对多”是指一个地方政府面临多个上级条条部门,与发包方视角的“多对一”相对应。

在地方政府“多对一”的情况下,不管上级条条部门采取何种策略(说服更高层级的政府下达政策、专项资金分配或者达标评比),地方政府必须面对与其他地方政府的竞争,参与竞争的强度就取决于上级条条部门的影响力和控制力以及政策本身对于地方政府而言的重要性。

地方政府在“一对多”的情况下会出现两个有趣的问题:第一,如上所述,因发包方之间通常缺乏协调和统一,各个发包任务或项目之间不免会有重叠和冲突,承包方对各个项目可以重新配置和整合,减少资源的浪费和过剩。第二,因承包方的资源和注意力有限,在完成多项分包任务时必然会有所取舍,权衡轻重,取舍标准与承包方的利益直接相关。

从上述“一对多”的角度出发,我们可以重新解释项目制下地方政府的两种努力(折晓叶、陈婴婴,2012):一是“项目打包”和“捆绑”行为(重新配置和整合),二是将不同政策目标的项目均服务于“搭建平台,招商引资”,即有所取舍和偏重。“项目打包”和“服务发展”虽然会导致项目实施偏离原有的政策目标而导向地方政府的特定偏好,但也有助于纠正发包方协调失败带来的项目重叠和低效。这里不仅仅是折晓叶、陈婴婴(2012)所讲述的“控制”与“反控制”的故事,这些地方政府的行为是在“一对多”的格局下的优化行为,有着其积极的意义。这也有助于重新解释社会学文献广泛研究的变通和策略行为(孙立平、郭于华,2000;王汉生等,1997)。给定众多发包方之间的协调失败和承包方的有限资源,如果严格执行上级的指令和程序,在地方层面上必然产生大量的资源浪费,甚至酿成灾难。地方政府的变通和策略在许多时候是一种重要的“纠偏”和“止损”行为。

3.3.3 “多对多”:综合的视角

“多对多”是指多个发包方面对多个承包方,这是现实中我们观察到的条块关系的全景图。发包方之间的竞争加上承包方之间的竞争,各自处于同级的竞争之中,又要利用对方的竞争关系,这导致发包方和承包方之间复杂而微妙的博弈互动。在这种“多对多”的复杂格局中,地方政府的领导必须具备统揽全局、权衡轻重的能力:面对各个部委条线纷至沓来的政策要求,地方政府谁也不能得罪,人员、资金、资源等方方面面约束条件多,不仅在中心工作(如经济发展)上要做出好于竞争地区的政绩,而且还必须在许多其他方面不能落后于人,根据属地的具体情况和条件,有所为,有所不为。我们经常看到地方官超负荷工作,用他们自己的话是“白加黑”(白天加黑夜),“5+2”(工作日加周末);出没于“文山会海”,应酬各种接待和考核。这是“上面千条线,下面一根针”的生动写照。但是,在这种繁杂紧张的工作中,地方主政官的领导力(leadership)极为关键,这是任何一级地方政府都拥有综合治理权的原因。[^10]

为什么上级条条部门通常没有对于下级地方政府领导的人事任命权(垂直管理部门例外)?这里最重要的是在“多对多”的复杂关系中给予地方政府统揽全局、权衡轻重的空间,防止权力领域的“公有地悲剧”。每个条条部门都希望地方政府为本部门的政策目标服务,在给承包方下达任务时,每个发包方会忽略其指令对其他发包方带来的负面影响或溢出效应,从而导致承包方接受过度的指令和任务。如果每个上级条条部门都拥有对于下级地方政府的人事任免权(比如任何一个条条部门都有对地方领导人事任命的一票否决权),那么可以想象,地方政府就会完全受制于条条部门的指使而疲于奔命,穷于应付,无法根据自身的条件作出独立有效的决策。

中国项目制最大的特色在哪里呢?中国的项目制的特色不在于它在中央财政支出中的比例,2000—2007年美国联邦专项项目支出平均占联邦全部支出的17%左右[^11] ,也不在于各中央部门的协调失败以及项目申请单位的整合配置(打包捆绑),美国也有类似情况。最主要的区别之一在于,项目的监察和检查权发包给了相关地方政府,通常是县级政府,上级政府乃至中央部委只是负责抽查项目执行情况。地方政府承担项目的主要监管责任,而在美国是联邦机构聘请审计机构审计资金使用情况,进行成果考核。当形形色色的专项项目资金落入一个属地,绝大部分由地方政府代为监管,地方政府就成为专项资金管理的“看护人”,这实际上赋予了地方政府综合考虑、统筹安排的空间,防止单一项目对地方政府造成过多的扭曲效应。在这个意义上,项目制作为条块关系作用下的制度形式具备了一些中国特色的内容。

基于上面的讨论,我们可以描绘出一幅中国行政发包图:首先是专项发包系列:从中央最高层开始,其次是中央各部委,然后是省级及地方各级相关局委办,专项发包方一般没有下级承包方的人事任命权,但有业务指导权。然后是整体发包系列:从中央、省、市到县、乡镇政府,整体发包方具有下一级综合承包方的人事任命权。地方政府既面临专项发包方,也面临整体发包方,这是我们从行政分包制角度理解地方政府和官员激励与行为的关键。

## 3.4 县乡基层政府间的关系：历史演变

按照前面讨论的中国行政逐级发包体制,县乡政府是政府事务的最后承包方,其本身呈现出许多独特的性质。而中国进入90年代以来的“三农问题”、县乡财政负债问题、乡村自治问题等等持续引起人们的关注,这些问题的凸显和基层政府间关系的制度结构有着紧密的联系。事实上,基层政府所面临的所有这些问题均是行政逐级发包体制在具体环境下的产物。行政权力的等级分配(权力向上)和行政事务的逐级发包(责任向下)作为我国政府间关系的主要特征,县乡正好处于正式权力的底端,同时又是事务的最终承担者,或者说权力最小和责任最大。

行政发包体制的一个主要特征是,当上级政府的财政压力越大时,它进行行政事务发包的动机就越强烈。20世纪80年代初推行“财政包干制”的一个直接原因是中央政府感到财政困难,需要调动地方政府创造财政收入的积极性。90年代以来的县乡财政问题也表现出同样的特点。县级政府觉得财源有限,就把许多事务推给乡村干部,并以军令状和责任书的形式迫使下级完成,有时还实行“一票否决”制,如财政收入达不到指标,就撤职降职。而且让他们自筹经费。县乡基层政府间的关系应该说最集中地体现了我国长期依赖政府间关系的内在特征。所以我们需要专门分节讨论。

在古代,县乡的关系经历了几次重要的转型。[^12] 秦汉时期,国家在乡设立基层政权,朝廷委任乡官,实行乡、亭、里制,以县统乡,以乡统亭,以亭统里。到唐代中期以后,乡官的地位开始下降,乡里制度由乡官制向职役制过渡。到了宋代,王安石变法推行保甲制,代表了国家政权正式从乡村社会的退出。从此之后,乡组织不再作为国家基层行政组织,乡里组织的领袖也不再是国家委派的官吏,而是地方社会推举的士绅,他们为国家政权代理一些行政事务,如征收税赋和维持社会治安。明代实行里甲制,本质上与保甲制相似,清代承袭明制。也就是说,从宋代以后,国家政权只延伸到县一级,县是国家最基层的行政单位,即所谓“王权止于县政”。县以下主要通过乡绅阶层和地方精英进行治理。乡村组织的主要任务是征收税赋、征派劳役兵役、维持社会治安和司法,这些基本的行政事务通过县级政府发包给地方乡绅阶层,县政府赋予地方士绅合法的权力资源(派征税赋和徭役)和社会地位,以此交换地方士绅的行政服务。

在中央到乡村的逐级行政发包链条中,从县到乡村是最末端的一环,也是发包性质最强烈的环节。需要指出的是,乡村自治在历史上从来没有真正出现过(瞿同祖,2003)。只有当国家政权出现统治危机,无暇也无力保持对乡村的控制时,乡村自治才可能出现,在正常情况下,国家权力总是试图控制士绅,官绅之间的合作更是一种常态,尤其在政府委托的公务上,绅权变成了皇权的延伸(于建嵘,2005,第103页)。乡村支持发包体制运行的行政基础在历史过程中经历过一些变化,但总体上说,县乡之间主要体现一种较为严格的发包关系。很早就有学者注意到:“对于整个权力结构来说,如果以县以下为界限的话,皇权与绅权一向是分工合作的。分工的方式相当于税制中的承包制,士绅在往昔似乎是整个权力结构中基层地方上的一个承包代理者或是受托的代理者,负责办理政府与人民之间的义务履行等事务,酌量各地情形拟订一个负责的标准,士绅即负责经手交纳,政府在经常的情形下照例不得另加干涉或多加勒索。”(同上,第99页)杜赞奇也指出:“封建国家的代表——知县,只有将许多行政职能‘转交’给有办事经验的个人或集团,他才能统治约有30万之众的县。”(杜赞奇,1995,第40页)

自清末以来,随着中国开始向现代国家转型,现代化的任务摆上日程,国家日益需要从乡村汲取大量的资源。这促使了国家权力向乡村延伸和发展的长期努力。1908年,清廷颁布《城镇乡地方自治章程》,划分了城、镇、乡三级地方建制的标准,规定城、镇、乡均为地方自治体。乡设立议事会和乡董,乡议事会在本乡选民中选举产生,作为议事机构;乡董为地方自治执行机关,实行议行分立。进入民国以后,乡镇地方自治体制大致延续,乡逐渐成为正式的国家的基层政权。国民党1941年颁布的《乡(镇)组织条例》规定乡设立乡代表会议、乡公所,下设民政、警察、经济、文化四股。乡镇公所接受县政府的监督指导,办理本乡(镇)自治事宜以及执行县政府委办事项。但是,这些设置更多流于形式。总体说来,民国时期在乡村基层建立国家政权(即官僚化)的尝试并不成功,国家与乡村还是严格的行政发包关系,国家政权对乡村社会的资源汲取更多依赖“乡村经纪体制”维系,国家的税收征收交由营利型经纪人负责,他们不在国家正式的官僚体制之中,通过为政府收取税赋而获利(杜赞奇,1995)。

自晚清以来,在国家与村庄之间的行政发包关系的发展过程中,一个值得注意的现象是,国家与个体地主和农民之间纳税关系逐渐变成了国家与村庄之间的关系,这在华北农村表现得非常明显(刘昶,1994)。从19世纪中叶开始,清政府因战败赔款和镇压太平天国的起义军,面临越来越沉重的财政负担,不得不把额外税赋摊派到村庄,要求村庄作为集体对国家的额外税赋负责,为国家收缴税收。作为交换,村庄的头目也被赋予更多的行政权力。这样,村庄日益被纳入到国家的行政系统之中。这种以村庄共同体作为国家动员乡村资源的基本单位的制度方式被后来的各种政治力量所利用,如北洋军阀、国民党政权以及日伪统治。但是,真正把村庄共同体改造成为社会动员的有效组织单位的是中国共产党。刘昶(1994)深入研究了抗日时期晋察冀根据地的税收改革和政权建设过程,发现共产党的税收改革贯穿了两个基本原则,一是村庄本位原则,二是合理负担原则。村庄本位原则就是强调以村庄集体作为征税单位,取消了以土地所有者个人为对象的田赋,把所有的税收归并为一种,摊派到村庄,要求村庄社区对国家税收负责。这些税赋最终还是村民来承担,但是共产党是按照村民的贫富差别实行税收的合理负担,采取累进制,从而有助于复兴中农阶层,阻止村庄内部的两极分化,为巩固共产党在村庄的政权基础创造了有利条件。虽然累进制的税收是通过改变村庄内的阶级关系来为当时的社会革命提供物质和人力基础,但是,这些阶级关系也是局限在村庄内部而发挥作用。正如刘昶强调指出的那样,共产党在加强国家政权对村庄的动员、组织和控制的过程中,严格执行了对村庄社区的垂直的行政控制,或者说严格的属地化的行政控制。这个原则体现为几个方面。第一,在村庄本位的原则下,每个村民都归属于其所在的村庄,他(她)与国家政权的关系通过村庄集体这个中介发生,国家政权把行政事务(如征税)直接发包给村庄,而非个人。第二,村庄的所有事务都在村庄的党组织和政府的领导下进行(“一切权力归农会”),实行一元化统治。第三,村庄成立了贫农协会、妇女联合会、青年团以及各种经济互助合作组织,但是,这些组织的活动和功能都完全限定在村庄这个属地之内,是归属性的组织,不允许跨越村庄之外进行活动,并在村庄党组织的统一领导和监督之下。传统乡村社区存在的各种自愿性的、与外界发生横向关联的组织和活动(如市场关系)被严格限制,因为横向的村庄之间的联系会对属地化的垂直行政控制构成威胁,削弱后者的权威和动员能力。[^13]

很显然,在抗日和解放战争时期共产党确立的对乡村的属地化行政控制的方式在新中国成立后得到延续,并有所发展。新中国成立后,国家政权成功地深入乡村,在乡村建立了基层政权组织,具体的管理体制几经调整。[^14] 新中国成立初期,乡镇体制采取议政合一的人民代表大会制度,行政政权的机关为乡人民代表大会和乡人民政府。乡人民政府作为乡一级人民政府机关,受区或县人民政府及区公所监督指导。此时的农村基层政权组织体现为两级结构:有的地方在县以下设立区和行政村,有的地方在县以下设立区公所,作为县政府的派出机关,在区公所之下设立乡政府。1954年取消了区村制和区乡制并存的体制,规定农村基层政权为乡、民族乡和镇。到1957年12月,除台湾和西藏的昌都地区,全国共有120753个乡镇政府。

为了从农村汲取剩余资源支持国家的重工业化发展战略,加强国家政权对乡村经济和社会的控制,从1956年始,农村开始大力推动合作化运动。新中国成立之初逐渐成立的农民合作互助组织和初级农业合作社,在很短的时间内就过渡到了高级合作社。其间最重要的变化是将原来属于农民所有的土地和其他生产资料收归集体所有,由高级合作社负责全社的农业生产、收益分配、生活管理和社会保障等各种事宜。1958年人民公社运动开始,撤乡、镇并大社,人民公社行使乡镇政权职权,农业生产合作社改称为生产大队,实行政社合一的体制,即生产组织与政权组织的一体化。高级合作社已经实现了农民所有的生产资料的公有化,国家已经能够有效控制农产品的生产和收购,那为什么还要进行人民公社化运动呢?除了意识形态方面的原因以外,一个可能的原因是解决国家权力体制在乡镇一级的对接问题(于建嵘,2005,第261页)。当时的高级合作社虽然具备一些公共权力,但基本上属于农业生产方面的专业性组织,更重要的是,高级社是乡镇体制之下的村级组合。而国家最基层的行政组织是乡镇一级,高级社所形成的权力体系尚未与国家的行政体制相衔接,这会增加国家全面控制乡村社会的难度。人民公社的建立,有效地把国家权力体制和乡村社会的经济社会组织结合在一起,真正实现了政社合一。所以政社合一是人民公社区别于过去乡镇建制最大的地方。人民公社成为了农林牧副渔全面发展、工农商学兵相结合、并与地方政权组织合而为一的地域性经济社会单元。在人民公社,公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所、理发室、公共浴室、敬老院、学校,应有尽有。当在人民公社的层面上,农民的一切活动(包括家庭生活)都被完全组织化了,在人民公社早期,甚至要求男女分开,集体住宿。当时对社员生活最典型的描述是“组织军事化,行动战斗化,生活集体化”。

公社采取集中的一元化领导,公社党委包办党务、行政与生产管理等方面的所有事务。人民公社化初期,公社领导在生产管理方面高度集权,统筹规划生产,统一核算和分配,对公社范围内的生产资料拥有所有权和调配权,经常对生产大队和生产队的物质“一平二调”,造成了很大的混乱和浪费。后来中央紧急下令调整,实行“三级所有,队为基础”的体制,要求公社下放一些自主权给生产大队和生产队,强调生产队是基本经济核算单位。生产大队和生产队主要从事农业生产,交纳公粮,落实上级下达的计划任务,维持社会治安,承担着经济、政治和社会各个方面的管理职责。在组织设计上,生产大队和生产队是一个高度同构和重叠的组织单元。[^15] 生产大队设有党支部、管理委员会、民兵、青年和妇女等组织,党支部除了负责党务工作外,还负责社区一切活动的组织和管理,并执行上级计划和安排的各项任务。每个生产大队的党政干部一般为10—17人。生产队设有党小组、队委会、民兵、青年和妇女等组织,每个生产队的干部人数一般在10人左右。国家通过对生产大队和生产队等基层组织的直接控制实现了对农村资源的控制和动员。

随着农村联产承包责任制的广泛推行,人民公社体制面临解体。1982年修订的宪法规定,乡、民族乡和镇是我国最基层的行政区域,乡镇人民政府实行乡长、镇长负责制。1983年中共中央、国务院发出《关于实行政社分开建立乡政府的通知》,要求政社分开,建立乡镇政府,同时按乡建立乡党委;建立乡一级财政和相应的预决算制度。乡人民政府建立之后,要依法行使职权,领导本乡的经济、文化和各项社会建设,做好公安、民政、司法、文教卫生、计划生育等工作。在乡以下建立了村民委员会,实行村民群众自治。村民委员会要积极办理本村的公共事业和公益事业,协助乡人民政府做好本村的行政工作和生产建设工作。值得注意的是,按照这一轮改革的设计,乡政府与村民委员会的关系不属于垂直领导关系,在人民公社体制下,生产大队要服从公社的领导。废除人民公社、建立乡政府的工作到1985年基本结束。

1992年配合全国行政机构改革,乡镇管理体制也进行了一些初步的调整。中央根据乡镇社会发展总产值、人口和面积三个指标,将当时全国48366个乡镇分为大中小三种类型,并核定了每种类型的机关人员编制,具体是,大型乡镇编制在45人以内,中型在30人以内,小型在15人以内。这些编制不包括事业单位和企业人员。然而,这些编制的设定很快被现实的发展所突破,乡镇机构膨胀、人员超编问题越演越烈,据统计,1998年山东全省乡镇党政机关平均编制是35人左右,而实际人员平均在200人左右(詹成付,2004,第3页)。

乡镇政府虽然是一级独立的基层政府,但它的机构设置各地差异较大。全国乡镇都设有党委、政府和人大,绝大多数设有人民武装部,个别乡镇设有政协联络组。至于乡镇办事机构的设置则很不统一。乡镇党委序列的机构一般包括纪检委、党委办公室、组织科、宣传科、社会综合治理办公室、团委、妇联、工会。政府序列则包括政府办公室等2—4个综合机构,一些地方对计划生育、文化、教育、卫生和乡村建设等职能比较单一的工作,分别由助理员专门负责。除了党政机构外,乡镇还设有数量庞大的“七站八所”,其中有县机关管辖的公安派出所、法庭、司法所、邮电所、税务所、粮管所和工商所等,还有乡镇管辖的文化站、广播站、农机站、农技站、计划生育服务站、防疫站、兽医畜牧站和种子站。乡镇管辖的站所从经费来源上,一部分来自财政拨款,一部分靠乡镇自筹。

乡镇一级的政府职能部门,根据人事任命权和经费来源的性质不同可以进一步划分为如下几种类型:一是上级垂直管理部门,即所谓的“条条部门”,如国税局、地税局、工商管理所、电管所和交管站。这些部门的人事和经费由上级部门解决,与乡镇政府无关,乡政府与这些部门只有工作上的协调关系。二是“全额拨款”部门,即人事权力在县级主管部门,但工资由乡镇提供,如财政所、经管站、计生站、统计站、城建站、广播站、文化站、水利站、水产站、林业站、农机站、企管站、教育组和公办学校。三是“差额拨款”部门,这些部门的人事权在县级,县级发放基本工资,乡镇给予经费补助,如农技站、兽医站、血防站、卫生院、司法所和土地管理站等。四是属于企业性质的部门,如粮管所、供销社、劳动力管理所和邮电所等。

乡级机构的设置在大多数场合遵循上下对口的原则,上级有什么机构和部门,下级也必须建立相应的机构和部门,而不是按照乡镇经济社会发展的需要具体设定。每个上级机构和部门都要在乡一级设立自己的“脚”,导致所谓“上面千条线,下面千根针”。乡镇机构和人员膨胀问题的根源之一就在于此。乡级“六大班子”,党委、人大、人民政府、政协、纪委、武装部,就是和县一级政府“六大班子”相对应的设置。事实上,给定乡镇政权运行的特定,这种对应并不一定符合效率的原则,如人大和政协的监督作用就非常有限。除此之外,县级的有关部门也分别在乡级设立管理机构,形成各种各样的站、所。

从行政逐级发包的角度看,乡镇成了最基层的承包方,如教育、医疗、卫生、基础设施、计划生育、环境保护、农业生产、最低生活保障,无所不包。乡镇成为国家一级基层政权,本身就导致了政府职权在乡村的扩张,而进入90年代,随着社会经济的发展,乡镇政权又进一步扩张和加强,国家权力大举进入乡村,号称“十几顶大盖帽管一顶破草帽”(李昌平、董磊明,2004,第15页)。乡镇政府职能扩张、机构增设与乡村经济与社会事务的发展有关。联产承包责任制推行之后,关于乡村土地管理出现了很多问题,国家颁布了《土地管理法》,为此乡镇设立专门管理土地的土地管理所以及与土地相关的建房办公室。民事纠纷增加和社会治安状况的恶化,使原有的调解和治保组织难以发挥作用,于是乡镇政府开始设立司法助理和民警办公室。

和县及以上的地方政府相比,乡镇政府作为一级基层政权,体现为“责大、权小、能弱”(徐勇,2003)。乡镇政府管理其辖区内的经济和社会的责任重大,是上级政府委托的所有事务的承包方和责任方,但是执行这些职责的权力和财政资源是相对不完整的,这体现在几个方面:一是在乡镇一级,条块分割非常严重,大量的“条条部门”行使权力,乡镇政府对它们的影响力比较微弱。县政府对于严格实行垂直管理的部门还可以在小孩入托等方面对其进行制约和影响,而乡镇政府就没有这些手段了,因为条条部门的工作人员的家属和社会关系都在县城。二是财政资源有限,税基严重不足。对于绝大多数以农业收入为主的乡镇来说,所能征收的税源非常有限,在农村税费改革之前只有“三提五统”,在此之后则是“两税一附加”,及农业税、农业特产税及其附加,2000年之后农业税也被取消。

新中国成立之后,村级组织成为乡镇或公社之下的一级行政组织,最初是“村政府”,人民公社时期更名为“生产大队”,废除人民公社、恢复乡镇之后被称为“村委会”。虽然名称不同,但它一直代表国家行政权力向村一级的延伸和渗透,在行政管理上隶属于乡镇政府或人民公社。1988年标志着村级组织政治地位的重要变化,由隶属于乡镇政权的下级组织变成了村民自我管理、自我教育、自我服务的基层群众性自治组织。乡镇政府对村委会的工作给予指导、支持和帮助,但不得强行干预属于村民自治范围的事项。村民自治制度得以确立。

然后,正如有学者指出的那样,村民自治并不是通常意义上的自治,村民委员会仍然具有“准政权”的性质。[^16] 《村民委员会组织法》规定,村民委员会是村民自我管理的自治组织,但同时还被赋予了许多国家职能,如协助乡镇政府开展工作,宣传宪法、法律、法规和国家的政策等等。村党支部对村民委员会还有领导之责。在具体实践过程中,村民自治受制于多种因素而大打折扣。首先,村的财力本来就非常有限,在有些地方还实施“村财乡管”,村干部不得不依赖乡镇政府获得一些财政资源;其次,在压力型体制下,县级政府的经济发展、财政收入增长、计划生育指标层层分解到乡镇政府,乡镇政府又把任务指标分解落实到村委会,因此很多收费是上级强行要求村干部向村民摊派,导致村干部与农民关系紧张。税费改革之后,村干部的收入报酬由县级政府部门下拨,不再由村民解决,村干部的行政化和官僚化的倾向进一步加重。

# 4 转型中的财政分成

中国政府间的财政分配关系从古到今遵循了一套独特的运行原则和内在逻辑。历史上由于交通、通信和监督技术落后,为了维持中华帝国的治理,政府治理的原则是以属地管理为基础的行政发包制。财政关系的安排完全从属于行政事务发包的需要,基层政府虽然承包了绝大多数的公共职责,但是朝廷并不保障其财政资源,而是推行“保证上缴,经费自筹”的财政包干制度。这个原则到了新中国时期当然发生了一些重要的变化。中国政府雄心勃勃的工业化和城市化战略以及经济计划需要中央政府集中大量的财力,国家的财政汲取能力随着国家政权建设的下沉而大为加强,工业化本身也可以提供传统农业社会无法企及的大量税源。这些都是古代传统的“无为政治”和“轻徭薄赋”所不能实现的。尽管如此,传统的行政发包制仍然在新中国的行政体制上打下了深刻的烙印,与此相对应,财政包干制的一些重要特征也得以延续。探讨新中国以来政府间财政关系对于传统力量的路径依赖是本章的一个重点。

政府间财政关系包括三个主要方面:政府间支出责任的分配,收入来源的分配和转移支付。在行政发包体制下,政府间支出责任在层层属地发包的过程中被固化了,基层政府作为最后的承包方承担了几乎所有的公共服务,不论这些公共服务是全国性还是地方性的。历史上政府间财政关系的调整主要围绕着财政收入的再分配展开,长期以来体现了财政分成的特征。

本章通过考察中国政府间财政关系的历史演变,试图强调如下的基本观点:新中国成立以后中国的财政体制历经调整和改革,但一直以来财政调整与改革的主线是解决政府间关于财政收入的创造和分配问题,更进一步地说,是围绕着如何在确保上级政府的财政收入的同时激励下级政府扩大财源和节约开支展开的;财政的公共服务功能从来处于相对次要的位置,它自然消融在行政事务的逐级发包之中而不被重视。财政体制的设计安排是为了便于上级政府向下级发包行政事务,确保上级政府处于治理和监督的地位。当今学界和政策界经常抱怨我国政府间的事权与财力不对称,基层政府缺乏提供公共服务的基本资源,这是完全可以理解的。事权与财力的匹配和有效提供基本的公共服务在历史上就不是我们设计政府间财政制度的着眼点,直到最近才有一些值得注意的变化。

## 4.1 改革之前中央与地方的财政关系

为了更好地理解改革开放以来中国政府间财政体制的特点和性质,我们需要了解1978年之前中国财政体制的基本特征及其演变。目前的研究文献对改革之前的财政体制的描述和分析大多比较简略,往往一笔带过,而专门研究新中国财政史和经济史的著述虽然重视史料的深度挖掘和客观描述,但对财政体制的深层特征和演变逻辑涉及不多。我们在下面将要用相当的篇幅回顾新中国的财政史,尤其要对中央和地方财政关系的性质和演变逻辑进行深入的剖析。我们试图强调两个基本论点:首先,新中国以来财政基本制度呈现显著的路径依赖和历史连续性,这种连续性使得重新审视历史可以更好地理解当今现实更深层的特征。其次,中国政府间财政关系不是单纯的财政收支在各级政府间的分配问题,它与央地的行政治理体制之间存在深刻的内在联系。我们必须将政府间财政关系置于中国政府治理体制(即行政发包制)的视角下进行考察,行政发包制的历史延续性直接决定了中央与地方财政制度的延续性。

在改革以前,与高度集中的计划经济体制相对应,中国的财政体制整体上呈现出高度集中、统一管理的特征,在文献中我们经常用“统收统支”或者“大锅饭”体制来概括,以此突出地方政府在国家财政体制中的消极地位。但是,仔细考察1950—1978年中央—地方财政关系的演化,我们很快就会发现“统收统支”这个概括过于笼统,容易造成误解。在计划经济时期,严格意义上的“统收统支”只短暂地存在过,在大部分的时期中央和地方的财政关系体现为程度不同的财政包干关系。换句话说,政府间财政管理体制一直在集权与分权、高度集中与财政包干之间来回摇摆,反复调整,表现出很大的变异性和任意性。如何理解这种制度持续调整背后的力量?为了回答这个问题,对于改革前中国政府间财政关系的历史考察就变得很有意义。[^1]

高度集中、统一管理的财政体制始于新中国成立之初,当时中国面临百废待兴、资金高度紧缺的严重局面,必须集中一切可资利用的财源,进行大规模的经济建设。而在国内战争时期,中国共产党长期遵循各个根据地自给自足的财政管理原则,财力高度分散。过去分散的财政收支管理体制显然无法适应大规模经济建设的需要。因此,1950年开始,中央提出统一财经工作的指导方针,统一全国的财政收支管理。所有的收入(主要是公粮和城市税收)几乎都集中到中央财政部门,留给地方的只是地方附加粮和非常有限的地方税;征收公粮(包括地方附加额)和税收的税则、税目和税率均由中央决定,地方不得擅自增减和变化。在支出方面,一切地方支出计划均需得到中央核准才能付诸实施。这是接近于真正意义上的“统收统支”制度。对地方政府来说,财政收支几乎完全脱钩,地方理财和发展工业的激励受到了严重的抑制。

中央很快意识到这种制度的弊端,1951年便决定做出调整,实施“统一领导”之下“划分收支,分级管理”的原则,赋予地方一定的财权。首先,建立中央、大行政区和省(市)级三级财政;其次,明确划分中央和地方的财政收支范围,全部财政收入(税收和国营企业收入)被划分为中央财政收入、地方财政收入以及中央与地方的比例留缴收入,其中货物税、工商税、印花税和交易税等一部分税种和烟酒专卖利润列为中央和地方比例留缴收入,留缴比例根据各地情况另行决定;农业税的超收部分也实行分成,地方工业利润可以用来发展地方工业。财政支出按照企事业和行政单位的隶属关系和业务范围划分为中央财政支出和地方财政支出。再次,将国营企业的一部分管理权限下放给地方。

虽然最终留给地方政府支配的机动财力仍然非常有限,这次调整仍然具有几个方面的意义。第一,“划分收支、分级管理”原则的提出,说明中央明确意识到地方财政不是一个简单的会计单位,而是必须保持其相对独立性,必须正视地方政府的财政激励,赋予其一定的财权和财源,否则,完全的“统收统支”只会严重抑制地方政府积极理财和创造财源的积极性。分级管理之后,如何在加强中央财力与鼓励地方增收节用之间维持适度平衡成为后来财政体制调整和改革的内在张力。第二,原来收支脱钩的分配方式有所改变,地方的机动财力可以用来发展地方事业,收支挂钩有助于调动地方政府进行财政管理的积极性。第三,确立了按照企事业和行政单位的隶属关系界定各级政府支出的基本原则,这个原则成为计划经济体制下财政管理的一个基本特征,和我们强调的属地管理和行政发包有着密切关系。

随着经济的迅速恢复和增长,政府所面临的财经形势有所好转,这为中央进一步调整高度集中的财政预算管理体制提供了条件。1954年,时任财政部长的邓小平提出财政工作的著名的“六条方针”,即:(1)预算归口管理;(2)支出包干使用;(3)自留预备费,结余不上交;(4)严格控制人员编制;(5)动用总预备费须经中央批准;(6)加强财经监察。提出这六条方针的基本出发点是要把国家财政建立在一个经常、稳固和可靠的基础上。为了实现这一目标,一方面要保证中央的统一管理,但另一方面,也必须赋予地方稳定的财力和后备力量,调动地方增收节支的积极性,支出包干和结余不上交就体现了这个原则。支出包干就是预算确定之后,各级政府自行安排,包干使用,不得突破预算。从中央的角度看,支出包干的意义在于事前控制地方支出的预算规模。“结余不上交”是与支出包干相配套的措施,就是各部门、各地方预算执行的结果有结余,不需要上交中央。“支出包干”体制自1954年提出之后就成为后来中央控制地方预算规模和鼓励地方积极组织收入的重要手段。

根据“六条方针”的指导思想,1954年国家预算体制做出了相应的调整。由于1953年大行政区被取消,财政体制演变成了中央、省(市)、县三级管理,乡级预算列入县级预算。财政体制在总体上仍然延续“划分收支,分级管理”的原则,同时也出现了一些值得注意的变化。

首先,收支被重新划分,收入被划分为固定收入、固定比例分成收入和中央调剂收入三大类。中央的固定收入包括:关税、盐税、烟酒专卖收入,中央国营企业的利润和折旧,信贷保险收入,中央的行政、事业、公产、其他收入等。地方的固定收入包括:印花税、利息所得税、屠宰税、牲畜交易税、城市房地产税、文化娱乐税、车船使用牌照税、契税、地方国营企业利润和折旧等。在中央和地方的固定收入中,行政隶属的国营企业所创造的利润是最为重要的来源,所以国营企业行政隶属关系的调整直接涉及中央和地方财源的再分配。中央和地方固定比例分成的收入有农业税、工商营业税和工商所得税。各税的分成比例由中央财政部按各地区收支情况一年一定。据统计,划给地方固定收入和固定分成比例合计一般可达地方预算支出的60%—80%,为地方预算提供了较为稳定的来源(董辅仁,1999,第249页)。属于中央调剂收入的有商品流通税和货物税,它构成中央的主要收入,用于弥补一些地方收入的不足。调剂的具体比例则由财政部根据各地区的预算情况相机决定。预算支出基本上按照行政隶属关系划分,属于中央的企事业、行政单位的支出,列入中央预算;属于地方企事业、行政单位的支出,列入地方预算。

其次,“支出包干,以支定收”。按照收支的事前划分,地方的财政支出首先用地方的固定收入和固定比例分成收入抵补,不足部分由中央财政拨款。事后预算执行的结果如果有财政结余,一般不用上交,由各级政府支配;如果收入短收,或者支出超过计划,也是由各级地方政府自己解决。

在第一个五年计划时期,中央财政直接组织的收入占45.4%,地方(省县两级)财政组织的收入占54.6%;中央财政支出(包括中央直接组织的收入和地方上缴收入解决的支出)占全部政府支出的74.1%。中央财政支出的高比例是由国家重点建设项目和国防、外交等支出造成的,这些项目支出均由中央统一拨款(宋新中,1997,第187页)。

“划分收支,分级管理”的财政体制在中央统一管理的前提下鼓励地方组织收入和节约支出,并赋予了地方一些机动财力。然而,这些机动财力却因中央部门统得太死、地方经济权限太小而经常发挥不了作用。在当时中央高度集权的体制下,人、财、物和产、供、销全部由中央部委统一管理,即所谓的“条条专政”,地方政府和企业的自主决策的空间非常有限。

受苏联模式的影响,我国计划经济时期的财政体制赋予了中央部委过于集中的权力,地方政府的支出决策严重受制于中央条条部门,缺乏自主性。1953年全国财经会议上提出地方形成的财政结余可以不上缴,其目的在于鼓励地方增收节支。然而,财政结余不上缴并不等于地方政府可以自行支配。在实际过程中,地方政府一旦遇到机动项目,就必须请示中央主管部门,等主管部门答复下来,时间已晚,该花的钱年内已经花不出去了,只好作为年终结余,上缴中央。中央就将这笔结余列入下一年度的预算,抵冲下年度的拨款。从1953年至1955年累计的地方年终结余高达30亿元(薄一波,1991,第481页)。1955年毛泽东外出视察工作时,安徽省委书记曾希圣反映,淮南两万多人的大煤矿,矿领导在财政支出上却只有200元以下的批准权,增加一个工人还需向上级部门请示。天津的市委领导也反映,新中国成立后5年中,中央只给天津地方工业安排了20万元基建投资,建什么都要报中央部门批准,甚至连市里设多少电影队,每队配备多少人,也要报经中央主管部门同意。许多中央部委强调垂直管理,甚至管到企业一级的处室,让企业非常为难(同上,第782页)。给定地方政府的财政支出权限如此之小,“支出包干,以支定收”的实际意义在于确定中央和地方相互承担的财政义务和责任,尤其是地方对中央承担的财政上缴的责任,而并没有真正触及地方的支出自主权问题。如果不解决地方支出的自主权,仅仅划分中央和地方的财政收入并不能够在根本上改变地方政府的财政激励。

中央部委的“条条专政”引发的条块冲突引起了毛泽东的注意,中央和地方的财政关系也随之进行了重大调整,过去的“以支定收,一年一变”的财政收支制度改为“以收定支,五年不变”。也就是说,从1958年开始,在划分地方收支项目和分成比例之后,中央承诺五年不变,而且地方在五年内可以根据收入情况安排支出,获得了重要的支出自主权。在此之前,中央首先确定地方的支出计划,然后按支出划给收入,并每年核定一次。具体说来,有下述几个方面的变化:

第一,在财政收入方面,地方财政收入被分成三种:一是地方固定收入,包括原有地方企业收入、事业收入、7种地方税收和其他收入;二是企业分成收入,包括中央划分地方管理的企业和虽然属于中央管理但地方参与分成的企业的利润,20%分给企业所在省市作为地方收入;三是调剂分成收入,分成的项目包括商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税、农业税和公债收入。

第二,在财政支出方面,地方财政支出分为两类:一是地方的正常支出,即由地方根据中央划给的收入自行安排;二是由中央专案拨款解决的支出,包括地方基本建设投资和重大灾荒的救济、堵口、复堤和大规模移民垦荒等特殊支出。另外,地方国营企业和地方公私合营企业需要增加的流动资金,30%由地方财政拨款,70%由中央财政拨款或者银行信贷。

第三,为了满足地方正常支出的需要,以省、直辖市、自治区为单位,地方收入项目和分成比例按以下4种情况确定:(1)地方用固定收入能够满足正常支出需要的地区,不再划给别的收入,多余部分按照一定比例上缴中央。(2)如果地方用固定收入不能满足正常支出需要,则划给企业分成收入,多余部分按一定比例上缴中央。(3)地方用固定收入、企业分成收入仍然不能满足正常支出的,由中央另行专案拨款补助。(4)以上3种收入全部划给地方还是不能满足正常支出需要的,中央给予拨款补助。

地方正常支出和划分收入的数字均以1957年的预算数作为基数。收入项目和分成比例确定后,原则上五年不变,地方多收了就可以多支。在预算执行过程中,收入超过支出,地方可以自行安排使用,年终结余全部留给地方,在下年度自行安排使用。

1958年的财政改革还涉及税收管理的改革。首先是简化税制,原来的商品流通税、货物税、营业税和印花税等4种税合成单一的“工商统一税”。征税办法也被简化,原来的多次征税现改为工业品在工厂一般只征一次税。其次是扩大地方对税收的减免权。地方政府对于地方税收的税目、税率的调整以及减税、免税或者加税拥有完全的自主权。包括中央管理的商品流通税、货物税、营业税、所得税等4种税收,作为中央和地方的调剂分成收入,地方也有权根据当地的实际情况,采取减、免税或者加税的措施。对于工商统一税的征收环节和起征点的规定,地方也可以机动处理。

然而,体制大放权、经济“大跃进”导致了地区分割、宏观失控的严重局面。1958年的体制没有执行多久就不得不改弦更张,变成“收支下放,计划包干,地区调剂,总额分成,一年一变”。除了少数仍然由中央直接管理的企业收入和不便于划分给地方的收入(如铁道、海关),其他财政收入全部划分给所在的省、直辖市和自治区管理,作为地方财政收入;支出方面也是把中央各部门直接办理的少数经济基建支出,还有中央一些必要的行政管理费用和国防、外交、债务支出之外的其他支出全部划给省、市、自治区,作为地方财政支出。收支包干的做法再次被沿用。地方财政收支根据有关指标核定,收支相抵之后收大于支者,多余部分按比例上缴,支大于收者,不足部分由中央补贴。在此基础上,收支包干使用,最后预算执行的结果有超收,按原比例缴留,中央补助款按原计划拨补,年终如有结余,归地方自行支配。这里的总额分成是指地方负责组织的总收入和地方财政总支出挂钩,以省、自治区、直辖市为单位,按地方财政总支出占地方财政总收入的比例,作为地方总额分成的比例。这一体制一直执行到三年调整时期。

1958年的权力下放推行于经济“大跃进”时期,运行时间不长却酿成了严重的经济后果,因此没有获得什么积极评价。站在财政制度史的角度看,1958年的财政下放是改革开放之前最为彻底的一次,其中蕴涵的改革元素,对于理解中央和地方财政关系的性质以及后续的演变具有标本的意义。与1954年相比,1958年的权力下放具有几个鲜明的特征。首先,“以收定支”取代了以前的“以支定收”。支出划分不再是用来事前确定中央和地方财力分配的基数。由于中央部委的权力大规模下放给了地方政府和企业,地方政府被真正赋予了自行安排支出的自主权。其次,中央对体制的承诺期从以前的一年变成五年,这说明维护财政分成体制的稳定性对于提高地方政府的财政激励是极为重要的。再次,地方政府还被赋予了相当的税收自主权,虽然是以税收减免权的方式体现出来的;结合第一条财政支出自主权,地方政府拥有了比较完整的财政自主权。在当时实行计划经济的体制背景下,这三个方面的制度改革均属于非常大胆的尝试,为后续的财政体制调整和改革奠定了重要基础。

1961年中央发布《关于调整管理体制的若干暂行规定》,回收了一些过去大规模下放的经济管理权力,把权力重新集中于中央。在收入方面,中央收回了一部分重点企业、事业单位的收入,作为中央的固定收入。在支出方面,则收回了基本建设的拨款权,改为中央专案拨款。同时还缩小了专区、县(市)、公社的财权。专区、县(市)以下的基本建设投资、国家支援人民公社的投资等,改由省、市、自治区专案拨款解决。在上收财权的同时,中央对税收管理权也进行了整顿,地方对税率的决定权和减免权也被严格限制。

从1966年开始,中国进入长达十年的“文化大革命”。这段时期预算管理体制因混乱的政治和经济形势而频繁调整。1966—1967年延续过去的“收支挂钩,全额分成”的体制。1968年,大批工厂停产,经济严重下滑,为了保证地方必要的支出,中央又不得不实行收支两条线的办法,凡是预算范围内的财政收入全部上缴,支出完全由中央支配,不搞收支挂钩。1969年因生产形势开始好转,财政体制又恢复到“收支挂钩,总额分成,一年一定”的办法。收支指标以1969年12月底中央批准下达的数字为准。在预算收支指标范围内,年终执行结果,以省、直辖市、自治区为单位算账。如果完成和超额完成收入任务,地方可自求平衡收支,超出分成和支出结余,归地方使用。没有完成预算收入任务的,由中央按预算确定的支出指标补助。

随着经济形势的好转,中央又开始把一些企事业单位下放给省县管理,为此,财政体制也做出相应调整,地方政府的财权进一步扩大。1970年,中央规定,在随后的五年内安排一定的专项资金,由省、市、自治区掌握使用,重点扶持“五小”工业[^2] 的发展,而且允许新建的县办“五小”企业利润的60%留给县,作为发展“五小”工业的资金。在1971—1973年期间,中央对省、直辖市、自治区实行收支包干的体制,即“定收定支,收支包干,保证上缴(或差额补贴),结余留用,一年一定”的办法。国家财政收入除中央部门直接管理的企业收入和海关收入外,其余全部划给地方。国家财政支出除中央直接管理的基本建设、国防设备、对外援助、国家物资储备等支出归中央外,其余也全部划归地方,由地方统筹安排。各地方的预算收支经中央综合平衡,核实下达。凡收入大于支出的,按包干数额上缴中央财政;支出大于收入的,由中央财政按差额数量包干给予补贴。在执行中,超收或结余都归于地方支配使用,超收或超支由地方自求平衡。

采取这种大包干方式的好处是,短收和超支,地方自己负责平衡;超收或结余,也归地方使用,鼓励地方政府为寻求边际赢余而努力;另一方面,随着大批中央部属企业、事业单位的下放,地方的财权相应扩大。但是它的一个主要问题是,地方收入难以准确估计,结果造成包干的上缴或补贴数额与地方实际的收入状况出入较大,导致各地区苦乐不均。另一方面,当地方出现短收,不能保证上缴时,只有要求中央补贴,而一旦有超收时,却可以作为地方政府的结余,归地方政府支配,进而出现包干制下地方政府“负盈不负亏”的局面。为了克服这些问题,1973—1975年,一些地区(华北、东北地区和江苏省)试行“财政收入固定比例留成”办法,即地方从负责组织的收入中按一定比例留成,作为地方机动财力,超收部分另外与中央分成,支出按指标包干。这样做的目的在于,保证地方一定的机动财力,同时激励地方超收,与中央分成。可是,由于支出与收入直接不挂钩,仍然不能改变地方“负盈不负亏”的问题。该方案最终没有在全国推行。1976年推行了一个改进方案,即“定收定支,收支挂钩,总额分成,一年一定”。中央核定省、市、自治区的收支总额,按照支出占收入的比例,作为地方分成的比例。在预算执行中,地方多收就可以多支,少收就少支,自求平衡,类似于1959年实行的“总额分成”制度。

图4.1给出了1953—1977年地方财政收入和支出占全国财政收支比例的变动情况,这在一定程度上反映了地方财政在一个高度集中的计划体制下所扮演的角色及其变化。注意这里的地方财政收入是指地方上缴中央之前的收入,地方财政支出是未计入来自中央补助的地方支出状况。数据始于1953年是因为1950年实行的是高度集中的财政体制,地方财政体制尚未建立,而1951—1952年,行政大区还未撤销。

图4.1反映了1978年之前我国中央与地方财政关系的重要变化。无论从财政收入还是支出看,1953—1957年代表了中央集权的财政体制,1958—1959年则是财政体制从集权走向分权的重要转折点。在财政支出方面,1958—1959年地方的支出比例从1953—1957年不足30%跳跃到50%以上,虽然1961—1962年有所下降,但之后的年份就再也没有回到1958年之前的水平,而是长期维持在40%左右,1971年之后开始稳步上升,1977年达到53%。由于这里的财政支出未计入中央给予的补助,实际地方支出额实际上比53%还要高出不少。在收入方面也是类似的变化趋势。自从1958年进入收入分成体制之后,地方政府承担了筹集国家财源最重要角色,从1953—1957年的20%升至70%以上,1971年之后高达84%—87%。

## 4.2 解析1978年之前的财政分成体制

如何认识改革开放之前我国财政体制的特征以及期间所经历的各种调整?这里有几个基本的观察值得进一步分析。首先,我们可以看到,凡是当国家经济形势好转的时候,财政预算体制就开始朝着放权的方向发展,而当经济形势变坏时,则又被迫收权,回到集中体制。这种体制循环就是我们常说的“一收就死,一死就放,一放就乱,一乱又收”。但是我们需要看到,财权的收放并不是简单的循环,随着每一次权力下放,地方管辖的企业和事业单位都在增多,即使后来再收权,也没有把之前下放的企业和事业单位全部回收。如图4.1所示,经过1958年大规模权力下放之后,中国的整个财政体制不可逆转地朝着分权的方向演进。总体来说,随着时间的推移,地方政府被赋予了更多的财权和财力,在地方经济中拥有越来越多的话语权和自主性,地方鼓励发展“五小”工业之后尤其如此。更关键的是,在这个收放循环的背后是毛泽东和主持经济工作的中央领导人之间关于国家经济治理理念的差异。毛泽东所想象的理想模式是地方分权,省区经济自给自足,小、土、群三结合,同时地区间相互竞争,发挥地方干部和群众的积极性。毛泽东坚信这个模式是实现经济超常发展的必要条件,所以更愿意站在地方政府的立场,鼓励地方向中央要权。当时主持经济工作的中央领导人(如周恩来、陈云)的理想模式是国民经济综合平衡,有计划按比例发展,因而更强调中央部委的集中管理和计划控制。正是由于毛泽东在党内的权威地位和长期坚持,中国在一个高度集权的政经体制下嵌入了一个地方分权的经济结构,这是中国经济“M型结构”形成的历史背景。

其次,新中国成立之后中央和地方收支的划分变动频繁,但是有一个不变的基本准则,就是各级政府的支出按照行政隶属关系来进行划分。属于地方管辖的企事业单位的收入和支出,一般划归为地方收支,而中央各部门管辖的企事业单位的收入和支出划归中央,属于中央的收支范围。和历史上地方政府的职能相似,地方政府需要负责行政管理、公安、司法、公共卫生、教育、医疗等几乎所有的公共事务。从1951年开始,中央和地方行政管理权限和预算管理权限的历次调整均沿着行政隶属关系的原则,通过改变企业事业单位的行政隶属关系来相应改变中央和地方的财政收支范围。行政隶属关系既作为财政收支的划分原则,又是政府间权力调整的基准,这反映了中国传统的行政逐级发包和属地管理特征的历史延续。

反映行政发包制延续性的一个关键性例证是,中央和地方的财政关系的调整始终围绕着财政收入的划分,而很少涉及中央和地方的支出责任调整。地方行政性支出(公安、司法、安全和检察支出)和社会性的支出(教育、公共卫生和医疗、社会保障、社会救济、农林水利等其他社会事务)60年代以来就属于地方全权管辖和负责的范围。即使到了今天,中央和地方的财政支出责任仍然保持相对稳定,即使经历了80年代的财政包干制和1994年之后的分税制改革,这些改革的核心仍然是围绕着中央和地方财政收入的分配而进行调整。1994年分税制改革之时,中央提出改革的一个动因是重新调整中央和地方的事权,事实上一直到现在也未做大的调整(楼继伟,2013)。从我们的观点看,这个“亘古未变”的地方政府支出责任其实是和传统的行政发包制分不开的。

再次,中央和地方的财政关系的安排,尤其是两者财政收入的划分(如总额分成或收支包干)涉及中央和地方的财政利益分配以及地方政府的财政激励,这如同委托—代理关系下激励合约的激励强度的决定。激励强度系数,即代理人从创造的收入中获得的分享比例,是激励合约当中最关键的变量。在我们的例子中,激励系数就是中央和地方的财政收入的分成比例。中国长期以来沿袭苏联体制,财政收入(包括中央的财政收入)一直由各级地方政府统一征收,然后再与中央分成或直接上缴。[^3] 这一体制传统直到1994年分税制改革之后国税局和地税局并立才被彻底打破。地方政府代收财政收入的体制特征决定了我国的财政体制必然具备“激励型财政”的性质。地方政府控制了全部税收的征收,给定税率和税基,也就事实上决定了财政收入总额的创造。如果不赋予足够的财政激励,地方政府就没有征税的积极性,中央的财政收入势必受到影响。[^4] 如果给予地方太高的分成比例,地方政府收税的激励会很高,但是中央的财政收入也会受到分成比例低的不利影响。地方分成比例过高也会导致地方政府分享收入的波动性太高,从而带来一定的财政风险。如何给予地方政府适度的财政分成比例,在提高地方征税和创收激励与避免收入波动风险之间保持平衡,是中国政府间财政关系的一个难题。

中央政府面对的另一个难题是,给定地方政府支出责任的刚性,如果地方支出过多导致出现财政赤字,最后还是由中央买单。即使中央要求地方政府自行承担财政赤字的责任,如果地方政府真是积累了大量的赤字,中央政府一定会“见死不救”吗?这里涉及一个承诺是否可信的问题,如同国有企业的软预算约束问题一样。如何防止地方财政支出行为的道德风险是政府间财政关系的另一个挑战。

面对地方政府创收的激励与支出约束两大难题,中国传统财政体制的解决之道就是划定地方政府的支出基数,包死支出基数,然后根据历年的地方收入情况,决定地方固定收入、收入分成比例(或中央用于调剂的比例),进而确定事前的上缴或补助数额,决算的超出部分可以自己留用,或者按照某个比例与中央分成。这是计划体制下中国财政体制的基本特征,而非严格意义上的“统收统支”。从这个意义上说,80年代的财政包干制承袭了这个设计思路,主要的差别在于80年代的包干制推行得更为彻底,中央对包干制的事前承诺更强。所以从上世纪50年代中期以来中国的财政体制就一直围绕着某种形式的财政包干思路进行设计和调整,而这也在一定层面上反映和适应了中央和地方行政发包关系的特点。中央政府在向各级政府进行行政发包时连同征税这个极为重要的事务也发包下去了,因而必须想办法如何给地方政府设计出合理的财政激励和约束。

在传统的高度集权的预算体制下,中央希望能够保持财力集中、统一管理的同时又调动地方增收节支的积极性,收支包干、结余自用、下放财力和财权、总额分成等等,都是朝着这个方向做出的重要尝试。但这种尝试都遇到一个基本的挑战:在一个高度集权的行政体制下,中央如何赋予地方足够和可置信的财政自主权?中央随时可以收回下放的权力,一年一定的财政分配规则,更改已经颁布的规则,甚至收回地方已有的财源。这些权力收放的循环和财政分配安排的相机性正是1953—1976年期间中国财政预算体制的基本特征。[^5] 中央规定的调剂收入就有事后进行相机调整的功能,地方对中央的上缴和中央对地方的补助也视情况而定,没有一个透明和确定的规则可循,而“一年一定”更是将机动性保留在中央手中。但是,财政机动性的保留也使得中央失去了可置信的承诺,导致地方政府的软预算约束问题。

假定中央颁布财政分配规则,允许地方政府支配其超收的收入,以此调动地方政府节约开支和创造财源的积极性,问题是怎样才能让地方政府相信,当地方真的实现了超收,中央政府不会突然变卦要求地方超收部分上缴呢?或者不要求上缴,但中央相机减少下一年的拨款数额。在收支包干的体制下,对地方政府来说最大的威胁是中央经常重新划分收支范围,调整上缴比例。因此,不论怎样的体制,“一年一定”的原则都会导致“鞭打快牛”的棘轮效应(Weitzman,1980)。如果地方政府预期到未来可能的调整,他们就不敢放手大干,以免暴露实力,而是留一手,韬光养晦或是藏富于民。我们这里的讨论的承诺的可信度问题决不只是一个理论的可能性,它在现实中经常发生,成为一个极为现实的问题。据薄一波(1991)披露,50年代很多地方政府想发展地方工业,扩大财源,但他们有两个顾虑:一是怕中央部门不给批准;二是怕一旦做大做好了,中央会把它们变成中央企业收上去。[^6] 事实上,这种担心到了80年代变成了现实,中央政府因财政收入下滑,不得不将一些效益好的地方国有企业升格为中央企业,其利润上缴中央。

在这种情况下,中央如何使其承诺变得可信呢?一个权力不受约束的强大政府通常难以给出一个可信的承诺(Weingast,1995)。而政府间的财政关系需要解决两个基本问题,一是中央对地方授权的可置信问题,二是地方政府财政的软预算约束问题。第二代财政联邦主义文献非常强调这两个问题的潜在威胁(Qian and Weingast,1997;McKinnon,1997)。这两个问题的背后其实是一个问题,即一个权力至高无上的中央政府如何做出可信的承诺的问题,所以这本质上是一个威权体制下的可置信承诺问题。

在实际操作过程中,对发达地区的“鞭打快牛”和对落后地区的预算软约束经常同时存在,而且,落后地区的预算软约束造成财政亏空,为了弥补这些亏空,中央政府对发达地区的“鞭打快牛”的动机也会进一步加强。如果不能很好地解决这个承诺问题,不管财政分配体制如何规定收支指标,如何实行收支包干制,最后形成的地方财政激励将大打折扣,如同“大锅饭”体制一样,干好干坏最后差别不大。发达地区即使面临强激励的财政合同也会悠着点,因为本期的高收入会导致下一期的更高的上缴指标;而落后地区面临收支包干的体制也不会奋起直追,因为实在入不敷出,中央不可能见死不救。这两种地区的理性反应最终都会导致中央财政压力增大。在后面分析改革开放以来的财政包干制度和分税制的内在逻辑时,我们还将回到中央的可置信承诺这个基本问题。

比较1958年的财政体制与之前的体制安排,我们可以发现,反映中央和地方财政权力消长的尺度有三个:一是究竟“以收定支”还是“以支定收”,收入与支出之间的关联性越强,说明地方财政的自主性越强。二是地方固定收入占地方预算支出的比例,这个比例越高,说明地方财政越有机动性,反过来,调剂收入占的比例越高,则表明事后财政相机调整的余地越大,对地方政府的激励越不利。三是收支划分的有效期限,说明中央对地方财政自主性的承诺,有效期越长,承诺越可信,自主性越大,比如1958年的“五年不变”比“一年一定”对地方财权的保护和尊重要更大。

在一个条块结合的计划体制下,地方即便被赋予了一定的财力,这些资源能否真正变成地方政府自由支配的资源,还取决于中央各个垂直部门对地方政府的管制约束。如果地方项目都需要中央部委的审批,那么名义上属于地方政府的结余收入其实没有实际意义。这说明了地方一级财政权与经济管理权限之间的互补性。我们前面已经看到,在“条条专政”的情况下,即便地方拥有相当的机动财力,也难以真正自主使用,导致下放财权的激励效果仍然有限。财权之外的其他经济管理权限的同时下放也有助于加强中央对财政放权的承诺。否则,地方领导意识到当前的财政放权是短暂的,一旦有上项目的机会就大干快上,动作慢了权力又要上收了。在“大跃进”期间就出现过地方挪用银行的贷款和流动资金进行基本建设项目支出或其他财政性支出的混乱情况。1958年和1959年共清理这种挪用资金100亿元,占1958年财政支出总额的四分之一(曲绍宏、白丽健,2006,第217—218页)。这可以解释为什么当中央真正想给地方放权时,一定是财权和经济管理权一同下放,而不是单项推进。这是1958年大规模放权的特点。80年代初开始的财政包干改革在很多方面借鉴了改革以前财政体制的包干制度,但有一个非常关键性的变化,即中央部委对地方支出的管制约束被大幅度削弱了,从而在真正的意义上增加了地方的财政自主权。

## 4.3 财政包干、分税制与新一轮财政改革

1978年12月党的十一届三中全会召开,决定将全党工作的重心转移到社会主义现代化建设上,这是中国经济转型与发展的一个巨大转折点,标志着中国改革开放时代的到来。70年代末和80年代初中共高层开始酝酿一系列重大的经济开放与改革的举措,其中极为重要的一环就是财政体制的改革。

1980年2月,国务院颁发《关于实行“划分收支、分级包干”的财政管理体制的暂行规定》,对中央和地方的财政关系进行重大改革,由原来的“大锅饭”体制过渡到“分灶吃饭”的新体制。按照企事业单位的行政隶属关系,明确划分中央和地方的收支范围,并根据这一范围确定各地区的包干基数。根据各省、市、自治区的具体情况,有以下几种不同的模式同时并存(北京、天津和上海三大直辖市不在“分灶吃饭”的改革范围内)。

第一种模式是,对广东和福建实行“划分收支,定额上缴或定额补助”的特殊政策。除中央直属企业、事业单位的收入(还有关税)和支出列为中央的收支外,其他部分皆列为地方的收支范围。以这两省1979年财政收支的决算数为基数,确定一个固定的上交数或补贴数,五年不变,其中广东每年上交1亿,福建每年被补贴2亿,除此之外两省的超收或节支的结余皆自行安排。在这个意义上,广东和福建的财政包干是最彻底的,两省成为真正的财政收入的剩余索取者。两省邻近港澳,海外华侨众多,给予它们特殊的财政政策是为了最大限度地调动其积极性,发展对外经济联系。

第二种模式是“固定比例包干”制度,只适用于江苏省。江苏省从1977年就开始试验固定比例包干的财政管理制度,即根据江苏省历史上地方财政支出占财政收入的比例,确定一个上交中央的比例,一定之后四年不变。1978年至1980年上缴中央的比例为57%,后来又略有调整。

第三种模式是推行“划分收支,分级包干”的制度,即按照行政隶属关系划分和核定中央和地方的收支范围,以1979年的收入预计数字为基数,地方收入大于地方支出的,超额部分按比例上交;收入不足支出的,不足部分由中央通过工商税调剂解决;如果工商税全部归地方也还入不敷出,则由中央给予定额补助。分成比例和补助数额确定之后五年不变,在此包干期间,地方多收可以多支,少收少支,地方自行平衡。这个模式适用的省份最多,达15个之多,包括四川、陕西、湖南、安徽、浙江等。

第四种模式针对内蒙古、新疆、西藏、宁夏、广西五个自治区和云南、青海、贵州三个少数民族比例较高的省,实行民族自治的地方财政制度,保留原来的对民族自治区的特殊照顾政策,与此同时,参照上述第三种模式划分收支范围、确定中央补助的数额,并由过去的一年一定改为一定五年不变。地方财政收入的增长部分全部留给地方,而且中央拨给地方的补助每年递增10%。给定补助数额与地方收入增长无关,这些省份所面临的财政体制实际上也是最彻底的财政包干制,即100%的剩余索取者。

为什么中央会采取财政包干制的改革?一个直接的原因是,“文革”刚刚结束的中国经济面临严重的困难,中央需要处理一系列历史遗留问题,如为大批的老干部平反,处理从农村返城的大批知识青年,提高农产品价格,提高职工工资等等,导致国家财政连续出现巨额赤字。1979年和1980年两年的财政赤字即高达204亿,接近于1953—1978年财政赤字的总和。正是在这种背景下,中央决定推行财政“分灶吃饭”的改革,调动地方增加财政收入的积极性,以减缓国家财政的压力。更为深层的原因是,让地方政府成为财政收入的分成者,结合其他的放权让利改革,可以使其变成改革开放的支持者,为后来的改革开放战略的推行奠定坚实的政治基础。

与传统的财政体制相比,1980年的财政包干改革有何重大突破呢?这里有两个重要的变化。一是更为彻底地推行了收支包干制,这反映在广东、福建和少数民族聚集地区的“固定租金制”,也反映在中央承诺力度的加大,由一年一定,变成五年不变。还有一个重要的突破是收支挂钩,以收定支,地方拥有统筹安排地方财力的自主权。在过去,计划管理模式以“条条为主”,地方的各项财政支出,原则上由中央的垂直部门审核分配,地方无法根据财政状况自主决定。而推行财政包干改革的同时,中央大规模下放了经济管理权限,“条条为主”逐渐过渡为“块块为主”,中央部委不再下达指标,地方有权根据中央的方针政策和地方的财力情况,自行安排支出。与此相联系,企业根据行政隶属关系上缴利润,地方企业的利润直接上缴地方财政,这使得地方政府对企业的经济效益变得更为关心,而这直接导致了80年代中期的企业承包制和行政事业单位支出包干的改革尝试。总之,这一轮的财政包干更接近“分灶吃饭”的制度安排。

需要指出的是,1980年的财政包干制的推行并不代表对过去财政体制的一次突变,事实上“划分收支,分级包干”的做法在过去也可以找到相似的实践,因而具有较大的历史延续性。比如江苏省的“固定比例包干”模式在1973—1975年期间就被东北、华北和江苏尝试过,第三种“划分收支,分级包干”模式和“文革”时期推行的“收支挂钩,总额分成”的基本做法也很类似。更关键的一点是,包干制从1958年的体制推行以来就一直成为中国处理中央和地方财源分配和解决地方财政激励的基本思路,差别主要在于包干的力度和中央对包干制承诺的强度。因此,我们需要看到这种历史的延续性。这种历史延续性的基础就是行政逐级发包制。一方面,地方政府作为几乎全部政府事务的承包方负责征收财政收入,然后上缴中央,中央必须依靠地方政府,赋予其组织收入的激励,同时约束其支出行为,尤其当中央财政困难的时候。另一方面,当中央在80年代初进行行政性分权、强化地方行政发包制的时候,财政包干制是与地方分权相互支持的制度安排。毛泽东时代也是遵从这个激励设计的原则,一旦放权,两者皆放,一旦收权,也是两者皆收。

如果要讨论改革前后的真正变化,我们必须从更广阔的经济背景去考虑。在财政包干改革的同时,中央对行政性分权和市场化的改革思路一直得以坚持和深化,给财政放权提供了良好的政策空间,而过去的收支包干制是嵌入在一个高度集权的计划体制内,积极作用有限。这是两者的根本性区别。

然而,新体制在执行过程中又遇到了老问题,即地方政府的“软预算约束”的问题。一些地方支出困难时仍然向中央要钱,而中央的各项支出承诺没有减少,最终导致中央财政的严重困难。自1979年以来连续几年国家财政出现赤字,中央财政非常困难,最后不得不向地方借钱。1981年和1982年分别借款70亿和40亿。1983年,中央不再向地方借款,而是改为调减地方财政支出包干基数,相应调整地方财政收入的分成比例和补助数额(宋新中,1997,第397页)。1983年起国家开始征收能源交通重点建设基金,一些骨干企业也收归中央管理。不仅如此,1983年财政包干体制还相应地做出了其他调整。例如,除广东和福建继续实行大包干外,有相当一部分省、市、自治区实行收入按固定比例总额分成的包干制。原属于地方的卷烟、酒两种产品的工商税被划归中央财政收入;一些企业利润上交和亏损补助的归属在中央和地方之间也做出一些有利于中央的调整。从这里,我们看到了落后地区的预算软约束如何导致和加强了中央对发达地区“鞭打快牛”的动机。

自1983年起中国税制进行了改革,企业原来上交的利润改为向国家交纳企业所得税,即所谓的“利改税”改革。与此相适应,从1985年开始,各省、自治区和直辖市一律实行“划分税种,核定收支,分级包干”的新预算管理体制。划分税种和核定收支是指根据当时的税种设置,财政收入被划分为中央财政固定收入、地方财政固定收入和中央与地方的共享收入,中央和地方的支出范围也根据行政隶属关系被确定。然后,根据划分和核定的财政收支范围,凡是地方固定收入大于地方支出的,定额上交中央;地方固定收入小于地方支出的,从中央与地方的共享收入中确定一个分成比例,留给地方;地方固定收入和中央、地方共享收入相加还不足以应付支出的,中央定额补助。收入分成比例、上缴和补助的数额一旦确定,便五年不变。广东和福建的大包干体制继续沿用,只是固定上缴和补助数额有一些调整。少数民族聚集的省和自治区根据中央核定的补助额,在五年内,每年按照以10%的速度递增。

新体制是对1980年初的“分灶吃饭”体制的一次调整。在1980—1985年期间财政收入增长较快的省区在1985年的体制下被重新提高了上交比例或减少了补贴数额,而处于相对不利的局面,组织财政收入的积极性受到伤害。“鞭打快牛”的棘轮效应再度出现。另一方面,中央的财政困难局面没有改善,甚至有进一步恶化的趋势。

为此,国务院于1988年发布了《关于地方实行财政包干办法的决定》,对不同地区实行不同的财政包干形式。具体说来,有以下几种主要的形式:一是“总额分成”:即根据前两年的财政收支为参照核定收支基数,以地方支出占总收入的比重确定一个地方固定的留成比例和相应的上缴比例;二是“收入递增包干”:以1987年的决算收入和地方应得的支出财力为基数,根据近几年的收入增长情况,确定地方的收入递增率和留成、上缴比例,超过目标递增率的额外收入全部留给地方,而达不到这个递增率则需要由地方自己补足,相当于对目标递增率进行包干;三是“上缴额递增包干”:以1987年上缴的中央的收入为基数,每年按一定比例递增上缴:四是“定额上缴或定额补助”:即按原来的核定的收支基数,收大于支的部分确定为固定上缴额,支大于收的部分确定为固定补助额。财政包干体制一直延续到1993年。

回顾1980—1993年的财政体制改革,我们需要指出,以分灶吃饭为特点的财政包干制和改革之前的财政体制相比确实取得了重要的进步。然而,问题仍然存在,尤其是一些老问题在新体制下没有真正克服。比如中央对财政包干合同的承诺的可信度一直困扰地方政府,形式多样的包干合同与中央和地方“一对一”的谈判,导致中央和地方的财政关系缺乏规范化和稳定的基础。财政包干意味着各个地区相对独立,地区差异日益拉大。采取总额包干的方式也抑制了税收可能发挥的调节经济的作用。当然,从中央政府来说,最核心的问题是,自财政包干改革以来中央财力占GDP的比例一直在下降,地方财政收入大幅增长的同时,中央的财政收入相对来说却急剧下降,严重制约了中央对经济的宏观调控能力。

关于财政包干制下的“一对一”谈判问题,学界多有指责,认为这加大了制度安排的任意性和非规范性。这是有一定的道理。然而,从中国行政体制安排来说,“一对一”谈判确实有其必然的逻辑。传统的分析把地方政府当作委托—代理关系中均质的代理人。事实上,从中央的角度看,各地的省级领导并不是均质的群体,他们之间年龄相差较大,职业前景激励也强弱不同。给定政治锦标赛下地方官员的晋升激励,一个理性的委托人势必利用省级领导不同的职业前景激励来相机设计相应的财政激励合约,如果对方职业前景激励强,事前或事后的地方留成比例可以更低一些,反之则需要提高地方的留成比例。“一对一”谈判就反映了中央利用各个省份不同的因素(包括地方领导人的晋升激励的强弱)达成最有效的财政分成合约的努力。[^7]

1994年的分税制改革是新中国成立以来最重要的财政和税制改革之一,改革的目的是为了扭转财政包干制下中央财政收入占全部财政收入比例持续下降的问题,也为了解决传统财政分成体制中一些弊端,如中央和地方分成比例缺乏稳定性、税制过于繁杂、地方任意使用减免税政策、“藏富于民”等问题。中央决定以稳定的税收分享体制重新调整中央和地方的财政收入分成问题。它的主要内容包括以下几个方面:

首先,划分中央与地方的事权和支出。中央财政主要承担国家安全、外交和中央国家机关运转所需的费用,中央直接管理的事业发展支出(如中央一级的公检法支出和文化、教育、卫生、科学等事业费支出),中央统管的基本建设投资,中央直属企业的技术改造和新产品试制费、地质勘探费、支农支出等。地方财政主要承担本地区的行政管理费用、公检法支出,部分武警经费、民兵事业费,地方统筹的基本建设投资,地方企业的技术改造和新产品试制费、支农支出,城市维护和建设费,地方文化、教育、卫生、科学等事业费支出等等。需要指出的是,这些中央和地方的支出划分基本维持了传统的政府间职责划分格局。

其次,以税种划分中央和地方的财政收入:财政收入被划分为中央税、地方税和中央与地方共享税。中央固定收入包括关税、消费税、中央企业所得税、中央企业上交利润,地方金融机构所得税,铁道部门、各银行总行、各保险公司等集中交纳的收入(包括营业税、所得税、利润和城市建设费)等。地方固定收入包括营业税、地方企业所得税、地方企业上交利润、个人所得税、城镇土地使用税、城市维护建设税、房产税、车船使用税、印花税、屠宰税、农牧业税、农业特产税、土地增殖税等等。中央和地方的共享税包括增值税、资源税和证券交易税,其中增值税中央分享75%,地方25%,证券交易税中央和地方平分。[^8]

再次,税收实行分级征管,成立国税局,中央税和共享税由国税局负责征收,共享税中的地方分享部分由国税局直接划入地方金库,地方税由地方税务机构负责征收。这彻底改变了过去所有税收主要由地方征税机构征收的做法。另外,中央税、共享税和地方税的立法权都集中于中央,地方不得任意进行减免税。

分税制改革的一项重要内容是改革过去种类繁多、税率复杂的流转税体制。传统的产品税从3%—60%不等有21档税率,所得税因企业所有制不同而不同。在新的税收体制下,很多传统的税种被取消或合并,如产品税和奖金税就被取消了。许多行业的营业税改为增值税,原来对外资企业征收的工商统一税也改为增值税,并统一规定为17%的税率。不论企业的所有制性质(外商投资企业除外),企业所得税一律定为33%。也有一些新增的税种,如消费税、土地增殖税、证券交易税。中国的消费税与西方国家的消费税不同,它只对烟酒之类的奢侈品征收,而不涵盖零售环节的所有商品。分税制改革将消费税划归中央,这使得一些主要依靠烟酒税收收入的省份受到很大的影响,如云南和贵州。

和中国其他的渐进改革相类似,这次分税制改革试图大规模调整中央和省之间财政收入的分成比例,仍然采取了较为渐进的方式。为了最大限度获得地方政府的支持,中央在新体制下对过去的既得利益格局进行了照顾和维持。这主要表现在两个方面:一是确保各省1994年的基本财政收入不低于1993年的水平。中央对地方税收返还数额以1993年为基期年核定一个基数。具体的税收返还的计算公式是:省的基期的留成收入—该省的基年(即1993年)的地方税收入—0.25×增值税收入。这种方式可以确保各省在1994年的基本收入不会低于1993年的留成收入。二是每年税收收入增量返还。具体地说,中央每年从一个省通过分享比例获得的增值税和消费税的增量部分以30%的比例返还给这个省。1994年之后中央每年的转移支付中有很大的比例是履行基数递增返还的承诺(黄佩华,1999,第28—29页)。这个政策显然对发达地区有利,而对落后地区不利,因为前者增值税的增长空间远大于落后地区。然而,当时为了获得发达地区对分税制改革的支持,中央也不得不采取更为灵活的应对。当时各省已经提前预期到1994年要推行基数返还政策,于是为了抬高1993年的基期收入而采取了所有可能的增收办法,包括让一些企业提前交纳税收。

相对于财政承包制,分税制改革在几个方面取得突破性进展。首先,从财政收入总额的大包干到税收分成彻底改变了过去围绕着收入基数和包干基数而讨价还价的局面,长期以来困扰我国财政体制的可信承诺问题(如频繁改变包干基数和比例以及“鞭打快牛”问题)在分税制下基本消解,地方政府自此之后可以把精力放在如何创造更多的财税收入上。其次,国税局的成立标志了中国财政体制的重大变革,中央终于有了自己独立的征税机构,而不再完全依靠地方政府的努力,这对于确保中央税收的利益具有决定性意义,在征税方面是对传统的属地行政发包体制的一次重要改革。国税局的成立拉开了后来中央垂直化收权运动的序幕,从各个方面冲击着传统的属地发包体制。再次,传统的完全按照行政隶属关系划分收支的制度在分税制下发生了重要的改革。虽然还保留一些行政隶属关系决定财政收支的痕迹,比如中央负责中央直属企业的一些支出,中央直属企业的所得税和利润仍然上交中央,地方也是如此。但是就税收的大项——增值税而言,已不存在行政隶属的划分了,而是不论何种隶属关系的企业,增值税都是中央和地方分享,这有助于剪断政府和企业之间的属地化的关联,让政府一视同仁地服务和支持企业,让所有的企业面临相同的税收环境。

值得注意的是,自经济改革以来,虽然政府间的财政收入分配体制变化不断,但它作为一个层层相叠的分级体系一直没有大的变化,包括1994年分税制改革之后(黄佩华,2003)。例如,中央政府与省级政府确定收入分配的规则,而且只和省级政府打交道。省级政府则与市级政府确定收入分享规则,市政府又与县级政府确定收入分享规则,如此等等。这个特征使得中国财政问题专家黄佩华做出如下评价:“尽管中国有一个单一的政府体制,但政府间的财政安排呈现出强烈的联邦制特点。”(黄佩华,2003,第2页)事实上,从属地化的行政逐级发包的角度看,这是一种很自然的制度安排,与发包的行政体制相适应。1994年的分税制改革主要调整了中央和地方的财政收入的分配,但并没有真正涉及中央和地方事权的重新划分,在支出责任的分配上仍然沿袭原有的层层分包关系。

经过三十多年的改革开放,中国从一个收入分配高度平均的国家演变成收入分配高度不平等的国家。在导致城乡居民收入分配不平等的一系列因素当中,地区之间收入差距(如城乡差距、城市之间或农村之间)一直占有最为重要的地位。[^9] 为什么中国的地区间会出现如此巨大的差异?其间的原因很多,我们这里不一一探讨。我们主要想强调一个非常重要的制度原因,那就是属地化行政发包制和财政分成制造成了地区间政府财政能力和人均公共服务水平的巨大差异。

改革开放以来,地方分权改革的一个重要特征是“以点带面”的地区倾斜式的分权策略,如经济特区、沿海开放城市、经济技术开发区、计划单列市等。“让一部分地区先富起来”的政策本身就造成了地区之间(如东部沿海地区与内陆地区)的巨大差距。而属地化行政发包体制和财政分成制就强调每个地区“自力更生”,“靠山吃山,靠水吃水”,主要依靠自身的资源禀赋和政府政策创造经济产值和财政收入,中央或上级政府的转移支付功能是相对有限的。如果一个地区经济发达,GDP水平高,政府的财政收入也就自然比较高,分成之后的可支配的财力相应较高;如果一个地区经济落后,那么该地区的GDP、财政收入和政府可支配的财力也就属于较低的水平。财政包干制时期下的地区差异自不用说,分税制虽然在增强中央财力方面有所改进,但仍然在几个方面造成了地区间财政能力的巨大差距:一是为了维持发达地区在1993年的财政既得利益,中央每年需要拨付巨额的税收返还;二是增值税在中央和省区之间的分享比例虽然对于全国而言是一致的,但25%的地方分享份额对于发达地区就是一个巨大的数字,由于各地人口增长较为缓慢,这意味着人均财政收入的巨大差异。[^10] 三是中央一般性的财政转移支付的规模仍然是偏低的,对于落后地区显然不利。而且转移支付中很大的一部分不是一般性的转移支付,而是伴随某些特定目的和用途的转移支付。另外,许多专项补助需要地方政府的配套资金作为先决条件,这为落后地区真正享受这些专项补助设置了自然的屏障。分税制改革之后省区的财力相对于中央的显著下降,促使省区政府把财政压力向更基层的政府转移,财权上移和事权下移,让省区内部地区之间的财政能力差距拉大,由于各地基层地方政府的事权高度一致,其结果就是政府公共服务水平在地区间的巨大不平等。最后,从80年代以来,地方政府日益依赖预算外资金和非预算收入,而预算外资金完全由地方政府自行分配,上级政府不参与分成。预算外资金来自对企业、农民和城市居民的各种收费收入,其规模在地区间差别很大。因此,它进一步加剧了各地区之间人均支出水平和人均公共服务水准的差异性。在“八仙过海,各显神通”的创收过程中,有的行政和事业单位也想方设法成立和经营各种营利性组织,设立“小金库”,创造预算外收入,“乱收费、乱摊派、乱罚款”的现象层出不穷,政府官员的腐败问题也由此滋生,给居民和企业增加了许多负担。

1998年开始我国从建设型财政向公共财政转变,启动了预算管理体制的改革。根据改革的设计,基于规范的预算编制方法和标准形成的部门总预算应该交由人大批准。在国库管理体制上,实行以国库单一账户为基础的国库集中支付制度,各部门只是预算执行单位、财政部门是预算拨付和监督单位,由此实现国家预算的统一管理和监督,有助于改变过去各部门账户林立、管理混乱、资金沉淀的局面。

1999年以来各地区、各部门不断推进“收支两条线”的改革。“收支两条线”包含两部分内容:一是收缴分离,政府部门和单位的行政事业性收费、罚没收入直接上缴国库或财政专户,部门不许截留、坐收,以规范政府预算外收入收缴。二是收支脱钩,财政部门编制部门的预算支出不能和该部门的收入挂钩,而是根据各单位的实际情况按标准核定并拨付的资金。深化“收支两条线”管理改革的宗旨是将全部财政性收支逐步纳入政府预算管理,杜绝游离于政府预算之外、不受社会公众监督的财政性收支,为最终编制综合政府预算、取消预算外收支做准备。

从行政发包制的角度看,国家预算管理制度的一系列改革的目标在于克服过去财政和预算层层包干之后形成资金分散、管理混乱、腐败丛生的局面。收支一条线在传统的财政分成体制中是经济激励的重要来源,单位的办公经费和人员福利依赖于服务收费和罚没收入,导致了政府和单位为了创收而“乱摊派、乱罚款、乱收费”。收支两条线的改革旨在切断部门预算与收费和罚没收入之间的联系,规范政府和单位的收费行为,而消除部门与单位的“小金库”也是为了达到“收支两条线”的同一目的。预算管理体制改革是向韦伯式科层制靠近,强调集中预算,规范管理,公共预算和政府人员的薪酬、福利待遇与政府公共服务产生的收入相分离,是对行政发包制的一个重要矫正。

然而,在实际运行过程中,我国预算管理体制与改革目标相比尚有相当的差距,比如迄今为止仍有60%左右的部门预算没有按法律规定交由人大审查,三公经费、彩票资金的监管存在空白,年底部门突击花钱现象突出,巨额财政款项和其他政府性资金沉睡降低了使用效率等等[^11] ,“小金库”长期以来是有关部门和单位的“私房钱”,多数用于单位发放职工奖金津贴,但游离于国家预算管理体制之外,滋生各种问题。1998年以来国家三令五申严加禁止,但多年来屡禁不绝。据审计署有关负责人透露,1998年至2006年上半年,全国审计机关共查出“小金库”资金(含挤占挪用)1406亿元,平均每年超过165亿元,其中2005年审计机关发现“小金库”资金高达312亿元,2006年上半年高达130亿元。据该负责人推算,以审计机关每年对被审计单位的审计覆盖面约为20%计算,1998年至2006年上半年期间,全国所有国家机关和国有企事业单位每年发生的“小金库”资金平均超过800亿元。有专家估计,包括机关事业单位和国企在内,如以宽泛口径计算,我国每年发生的“小金库”资金总额或在1000亿元以上。[^12] “收支两条线”也并未杜绝一些部门和单位将收费和罚没收入与预算挂钩的做法。

上述的问题都表明改革传统的财政分成体制的困难所在。这一方面与缺乏外部监督改革和内部制约有关,另一方面,也是更关键的是,财政分成制度是行政发包制不可分割的一部分,如果行政发包制的其他维度不变,如“属地发包”、“上级请客,下级买单”、结果导向的考核,走向真正严格规范的预算管理体制还是非常困难的。

最近中国财政和预算管理体制的改革迈出了新的步伐。2014年颁行了《新预算法》,明确提出政府预算管理的宗旨是规范政府收支行为,强化预算约束,加强对预算的管理和监督,建立健全全面规范、公开透明的预算制度。这意味着预算管理从过去“帮助政府管钱袋子”转变为“规范政府钱袋子”,政府成为被约束和监督的对象,这是中国预算管理理念的一个巨大的进步。基于这个原则,政府预算采取全口径方式,政府的全部收入和支出都应当纳入预算。除一般公共预算外,政府性基金预算、国有资本经济预算、社会保障预算也将纳入预算管理范畴,各级政府、各部门、各单位的支出必须以经批准的预算为依据,未列入预算的不得支出。流行多年的预算外资金随之取消。

正如我们前面讨论的,历史上所有的财政改革都是以调整中央和地方的财政收入为主,很少涉及两者的事权划分,而事权划分是以属地化行政发包制的方式确定的。属地发包不区分公共服务的受益范围,绝大部分公共服务层层分包给了各级地方政府,包括一些本属于中央政府负责的事务,如国界河湖保护、跨流域大江大河的治理、跨地区环境治理、跨地区经济纠纷司法管辖、海域和海洋的使用管理等(楼继伟,2013)。属地发包的另一个特征是,地方政府的事权与财力不匹配,地方政府预算内财力有限,高度依赖于非正式财政体系(如预算外财政)提供基本公共服务,导致各地区公共服务水平差距巨大。

中国传统的财政分成体制与西方发达国家的公共财政原则形成了鲜明的对比。在西方发达国家的财政体制中,政府间财政关系最核心的原则是根据公共产品的受益范围决定各级政府的职责分工,然后根据各级政府的职责决定财政收入的分配和再分配(转移支付)。各级政府的公共职责又是由辖区居民均等化的公共服务要求决定的。如何为地方政府提供足够的财源、使之有效履行政府职责、提供必要的公共服务是政府间财政制度设计的一个核心目标。除此之外,制度设计还需考虑地方政府决定地方事务的自主权和行政过程的可问责性。地方政府财权(地方自有收入)和事权(支出责任)并不要求严格匹配和统一,但财力和事权的统一则是一个基本要求。地方政府的财权与财力的差异是由上级政府的转移支付进行弥补的。在西方发达国家,来自中央政府和省(州)政府的转移支付一直构成基层地方政府的主要收入来源。

2016年8月24日,国务院发布了《关于推进中央与地方财政事权和支出责任划分改革的指导意见》(以下简称《指导意见》),就中央与地方重新划分事权及支出责任提供了原则性意见,标志着中国财政体制朝着现代公共财政体系迈出了关键性的一步。《指导意见》指出,划分中央与地方支出责任的原则是基本公共服务的受益范围,中央负责体现国家主权、维护统一市场以及受益范围覆盖全国的基本公共服务,地方政府负责地区性基本公共服务,而跨省(区、市)的基本公共服务则由中央和地方共同负责。根据这个原则,中央将加大支出责任,尤其在全国性公共产品(如重大传染病防治、全国性大通道、基本养老和医疗保险、基本医疗和公共卫生)和跨地区环境保护、基础设施等方面。《指导意见》不仅明确了中央和地方的事权边界,还强调了与事权相一致的财政责任边界。属于中央的财政事权,应当由中央财政安排经费,中央各职能部门和直属机构不得要求地方政府安排配套资金;中央的财政事权如委托地方行使,必须给予地方相应的经费。过去长久以来,上级政府利用不对称的权力将属于本级的支出责任随意转嫁给下级政府,导致“事权下压,财权上移”的现象经常发生。“上级点菜、下级买单”的做法也增加了地方政府预算支出的不确定性和财政负担。《指导意见》提出“谁的财政事权谁的支出责任”这个原则,旨在防止上级政府事后转移支出责任的情况。但是,给定“官大一级压死人”的典型事实,在实际过程中如何真正防止此类情况的发生,还有待于相关制度(如争议裁决、支出责任划分的法治化)的完善。

如此大规模重新划分中央和地方以及省以下地方政府的事权应该是史上第一次。《指导意见》提出的一系列关于重新划分中央和地方支出责任的思路和原则更好地体现了现代公共财政的精神,对于打破传统属地化行政发包制、建立中国新型财政体制具有里程碑的意义。

## 4.4 预算外财政

预算外资金是指不纳入国家预算管理,由各部门、各地区、各单位根据国家法律、法规和规章自收自支、自行支配的财政性资金,包括地方财政部门掌握的预算外资金(如企业的折旧基金),行政事业单位的收费收入以及企业掌握的各项专用基金,如更新改造基金,大修理基金,职工福利基金、生产发展基金等。它相当于地方可以自由支配的“小金库”。预算外资金一般适用于省和市级政府的资金,而自筹资金一般指县和乡支配的资金(黄佩华,1999,第51页)。

在改革开放之前预算外资金并没有形成地方政府重要的资金来源。新中国成立之初,预算外资金只包含少量的税收附加收入和少数的专项事业收入,在地方财政中所占的比例非常之小。1953 年,中央决定实行“统一领导、分级管理”的财政管理体制,适当扩大地方的机动财力。为此,企业管理的专项基金(如企业奖励基金、福利基金和大修理基金)、地方政府的工商税附加(主要用于城市公用事业的维护)、公路养路费、中小学杂费等事业收入,被列入预算外资金管理。各单位的一些零星杂项收入由单位自收自支。1958年之前预算外资金占国家预算收入的比例一直维持在6%—9%。到了“大跃进”时期,在地方的预算内收支的自主性大为增长的同时,预算外资金迅速膨胀,1960年高达20%(《中国统计年鉴(1991)》)。但很快中央就加强了各地区、部门和单位的预算外资金的统一管理,规定凡是用预算外兴办的企业的收入一律纳入国家预算。因此,预算外资金的规模开始下降,预算外资金占预算内收入的比例由1960年的20.6%降到1965年的16%。70年代以后随着地方“五小”工业的蓬勃发展,预算外收入又开始快速增长,预算外收入占预算内收入的比例超过30%以上。

在改革开放之后,预算外资金日益成为地方各项支出的重要来源。它急剧增长的规模,尤其是收入来源和手段的非规范性,引起了中央的注意。1986 年,国务院颁布了《关于加强预算外资金管理的通知》,正式出现了预算外资金的概念,将预算外资金界定为由各地区、各部门和各单位依据国家有关规定,自行提取、自行使用的不纳入国家预算的资金。1993 年,国营企业的预算外资金除上交国家税收外,完全由企业自由支配,不再列入预算外资金。鉴于预算外资金规模庞大、管理较为混乱的局面,中央从1996年开始对预算外资金的管理进行了一系列改革,使之逐渐纳入规范化、可监督、向预算内转化的轨道,主要经历了以下两个发展阶段:

第一个阶段,重新界定预算外资金的性质,将它界定为国家机关、事业单位和社会团体为履行或代行政府职能,依据国家法律、法规和具有法律效力的规章而收取、提出和安排使用的未纳入预算管理的各种财政性资金。同时要求预算外资金必须统一纳入财政部门在银行开设的财政专户进行管理,接受财政部门的监督。虽然还没有收归国库,实际使用权还在各个部门和单位手里,但预算外资金的性质已经发生了变化,不再是各单位的“私房钱”,而是属于财政性资金,财政专户管理,必须受到财政部门监督。

第二个阶段,从1999年开始对行政事业单位的收费和罚没收入实行“收支两条线”管理,将所有的非税收入全部纳入同级财政专户管理,支出由同级财政按照预算外收支计划和单位财政收支计划统筹安排,从财政专户拨付,逐步实现预算内管理。自2001年始,公安、司法、海关、工商和环保部门的行政性收费和罚没收入全部纳入预算内管理,而且实行“收支脱钩”。

表4.1列举了自1982—2010年以来中国地方政府预算外收入历年的数额以及比例的变化。[^13]

从表4.1可以看出,从80年代初期开始,预算外收入在地方的收入来源中就占据了非常重要的位置。我们以预算外收入占预算内收入的比例为标准衡量预算外收入的重要性,它从1982年的61%一路攀升到1988年的92%,达到历史的最高点,然后逐渐有所下降。但即便是下降的趋势,除了1993年的35%比较特殊以外[^14] ,这一比例长时期仍然维持在一个较高的水平,到2005年才降到三分之一略强。这说明预算外收入一直是地方进行各项支出的重要来源。关于地方预算外收入的意义,还可以从它与中央预算外收入的比较去理解。中央预算外收入在80年代增长迅速,80年代中期以后甚至超过预算内收入,但1993年之后就迅速下降到很不重要的位置。因此,地方预算外收入占中央预算外收入的比例先是从接近于两倍的水平逐渐下降,在1993年猛然上升到4.83倍,然后维持一个稳步上升的趋势。2005年地方预算外收入的规模是中央的大约13倍之多。2005年之后预算外收入占预算内收入的比例逐年下降,到2010年已降至13%。

各个地区对预算外资金的依赖程度也很不一样。我们使用省级水平1987—2010年的预算外收入数据,可以发现,各省在此期间平均的预算外收入占预算内收入的比例为0.58,标准差为0.30,其中最高的比例为1.64,最低的比例为0.05。[^15] 人均GDP水平高的地区,预算外收入所占比例一般较低,而落后地区对预算外收入的依赖程度则更高。

预算外资金就其性质而言是国家为了刺激各个地方政府和部门发展经济、举办赢利性活动的积极性,而留给地方和部门的机动财力和财权。从1986年开始,我国政府明文将完整的财政资金切割为预算内、预算外两大块,并明确规定了预算外资金的所有权与使用权归属地方、部门和单位,中央不参与分配,也不支配其使用,形成了事实上的国家预算的双轨制。在预算内地方与中央进行财政分成,而在预算外,地方创造的收入百分之百归地方的政府、部门或单位所有,其支出也享受充分的自主权。我们前面的数据表明,预算外资金占预算内资金的比例在改革以来一直维持在非常高的水平。预算外资金规模庞大,收支不透明,管理缺乏规范,经常导致“乱收费、乱罚款、乱摊派”,企业和居民怨声载道。那么,为什么中国长期以来会允许预算外财政的存在呢?

我们认为有两个可能的原因可以解释它的长期存在。第一个原因和中国行政逐级发包体制有着密切的联系。我们在第2章曾经阐述过,中国从中央到各级地方政府,从政府到国有企业和事业单位,实际上是一个逐级发包的过程。如果先不考虑国有单位之外的企业和个人,在预算内收入方面,是从最基层的国有企业和事业单位逐级向上上缴,逐级实行财政分成;在预算内支出方面,上级机关给下级政府、部门或单位下达支出预算,实行支出包干。通常来说,上级给下级单位核定的支出预算都非常紧张,一般是不足的。这种紧张的支出预算在各级政府间或发包的链条间逐级传递。事实上,许多政府部门和企事业单位经常抱怨上级拨付的经费预算只够最基本的支出,如工资支出和少量的办公费用,基本上属于“吃饭财政”,而且在支出包干制下上级拨付的预算是刚性的。虽然支出预算是刚性的,但下级机关和单位的支出负担可不是固定的。

在中国的行政体制下,行政发包制通常给承包方的财政预算施加了双重的压力。第一重压力来自“属地管理”和“整体发包”所带来的无限责任,即属地所发生的任何事情都是地方主政官的行政责任,在这个意义上,承包合同是一个不完全合约,有许多未明示、预料之外的事态需要承包方去处理和解决,而这部分的预算未必是纳入计划的,事实上也难以事前计划好,经常是承包方自己筹资解决。第二重压力是发包方与承包方的权力不对称带来的结果。一种情况是“上级请客,下级买单”,上级政府提出一些新的政策方针或施政要求,不在正常预算之内,但下级必须积极响应,认真履行,而所需资金只能自己解决。另一种情况是,上级政府经常利用其“官大一级”的优势把一些本来应该由自己完成的职责和任务强行下放和摊派给下级机关,把财政压力转嫁给下属。在这种情况下,如果只允许有预算内财政,那么下级部门要么减少上缴收入的比例,要么大幅度紧缩开支,减少职责范围。第二重压力本质上也是让下级政府(承包方)成为剩余责任承担者和无限政府。解开这个财政困局的办法是,允许下级机关和单位设立预算外财政,鼓励它们创收,用预算外收入补贴预算内的支出不足,从而减缓上级政府所面临的财政压力。在中国的语境下,上级如果不给钱,就得给政策,让下级部门创收自救。如果上级面临的财政约束较大的话,“给政策”是必然的选择。在一定程度上,预算外财政的存在就是在中国行政逐级发包的体制下“事务发包,经费自筹”原则的一个局部体现,是“给钱”和“给政策”之间权衡的结果。从这个角度看,要取消预算外财政,从中央开始必须要有足够的财政力量,保证各级地方政府和事业单位足额的财政经费,否则难以持久。

一个“无限政府”与以规范和程序为基础的预算管理(如先制定和通过预算,然后严格执行预算)是不兼容的,无限政府必须配备具有灵活性的预算来源,否则难以正常运作。也许以后不叫“预算外收入”,但行政发包体制下承包方作为“无限政府”、承担“无限责任”的属性不改变,类似“预算外收入”的灵活预算安排一定会内生出来。

第二个原因涉及中国财政体制下可置信承诺的问题,其实也与发包方和承包方不对称的权力相关。在财政分权时期,形形色色的预算内收入的包干制都涉及核定收入基数的问题,它是总额分成和超收分成的基础。当财政体制经常变化,尤其是当上级政府可以利用体制调整相机修改下级政府的收入基数时,鞭打快牛的棘轮效应就出现了。财政收入增长快的地区,收入基数高,未来超收的难度也就越大。如果政府间只有预算内收支,没有任何预算外和自筹收入,那么上级政府的承诺的可信度问题对下级政府的增收激励就会构成一个严重的威胁。而允许预算外资金的存在,允许下级单位设立不与上级机构分享、甚至不让上级知情的“小金库”,相当于是事前做出了关于一个可信的承诺,那就是不会与下级争夺这块资金,下级单位尽可以自收自支。这等于给予下级政府部门和单位对于这部分资金的全部产权,从而激发这些政府部门和单位去创造更多的财源,比如乡镇干部为了增加预算外资金而积极扶持或参与乡镇企业的经营和管理,使得乡镇企业“异军突起”,在中国工业化、城市化过程中扮演了极为重要的角色。[^16] 在这个背景下,我们可以更深刻地理解中国财政体制下预算外资金和非预算资金存在的独特意义。

随着“收支两条线”等预算管理体制的改革,预算外收支逐渐被纳入到正式的预算管理范围。2014年新预算法的颁布确立了政府全口径预算的原则,宣告了盛行多年的预算外收入的结束。然而,在行政发包制下上下级不对称性权力、承包方的“无限责任”、上级发包方的可置信承诺问题并不因为预算外收入的消失而消失,如上述分析所表明的那样,除非行政发包制的其他维度也相应发生变化,比如从属地发包走向有限政府,从权力的行政性安排走向依法行政和法治化,否则预算外收入仍然可能以隐蔽或变种的方式存在。[^17]

## 4.5 省以下政府间的财政分成

中国政府间财政关系的一个基本特征是,在中国行政体制的五级政府(中央、省、地级市、县、乡)之间,相邻两级政府间的财政关系总是由上一级的政府全权决定,比如中央决定中央与省级政府的财政分配关系,省决定省政府与地级市的财政关系,依次类推。这种安排赋予了省和省以下政府确定财政关系的机动性,同时也导致各地区之间省以下财政体制的巨大差异性。从一个高度集权的行政体制来看,中国的政府间财政制度的设计权的分配还是具有很显著的分权特征的。这实际上从另一个侧面反映了中国行政体制逐级发包的特征的影响:逐级发包的基本特征就是每一级承包方只管对上一级发包方负责,而每一次发包方(或转包方)也主要管下一级承包方就行了,很少发生跨级干预和影响。从过去的实践看,省以下政府间财政分配体制通常参照中央与省的财政体制的基本安排,但具体做法千差万别。

4.5.1 财政包干时期

在1980—1985年“划分收支、分级包干”时期,实行“划分收支、分级包干”的省份也对地市建立了类似的体制。省在制定包干办法时基本是根据中央对省包干方法的精神。例如,辽宁省规定地方财政收支的包干基数以1979年执行数为基础,经过适当调整后计算确定。收大于支的,多余部分按一定的比例上缴;支大于收的,不足部分由省级财政给予定额补助。

虽然总体上各省对地市的包干方法大部分内容都参照了中央与省的办法,但是各省也根据具体的情况进行了因地制宜的创新。例如,在江西省,南昌、景德镇、萍乡三市调剂收入上交比例较大,为了调动其组织工商税收的积极性,当年比上年实际增收的工商税收,由省给予南昌市40%、景德镇和萍乡市各50%的照顾。贵州省对各地在体制上做出了较大的让步。中央对贵州省是以1979年的预算数作为预算收入基数的,而省对各地是以1979年的实际完成数为基数。中央对贵州省预算支出基数的确定是以1979年预算支出数压缩10%后确定的,而省对各地则是根据1979年预算支出数压缩5%后确定的。

1985—1988年,中央对省原打算实行“划分税种,核定收支,分级包干”的财政体制,后来由于按照税种划分的条件还不具备。1985年和1986年,暂时实行“总额分成”的办法。在这一阶段,省对地市的财政体制也在微调中不断完善。

有些省为了发挥市、县发展经济的积极性,制定了“增长分档分成”的办法。例如,山东省1987年对部分省实行“定额上缴加增长分档分成办法”,对淄博、济南、潍坊3个市增长8%—15%部分,省与市三七分成;增长15%以上的部分全部留市。对烟台市收入比上年增长部分,增长幅度在8%以内的另加增长分成5%;8%—15%部分,再加增长分成10%;增长15%以上全部留市。在这一时期,为了改变县级经济落后状况,有些省实行了县级经济体制综合改革。例如,安徽省1985年对涡阳县、宿县等22个县试行经济体制综合改革,在财政管理体制上给予优惠政策。具体方法是区别试点县情况,分别确定5%—10%的财政收入递增速度,实行递增上缴或递增补助,达到递增速度以上的超收部分,除上缴中央财政20%外,全部留给县,省不参与分成。对临泉、金寨两县更加优惠,其超过包干收入基数的收入,应上缴中央财政的20%由省代缴。

1988年,中央对安徽省继续实行“总额分成”的办法,总额留成比例为77.5%,上缴比例为22.5%。同年,安徽省人民政府调整了对各市、县的财政体制,分成办法为“定额上缴递增,定额补助递减”,执行三年。省政府根据近两年收入情况和财力情况,将74个县(市)划分为四类。阜阳、亳州市的财政收入递增率为7%,包干上缴比例为36.6%;滁州等24个县(市)的财政收入递增率为6%,包干上缴比例为30%;桐城等194个县(市)的财政收入递增率为5%,包干上缴比例为22.5%,望江等29个县(市)的财政收入递增率为4%,包干上缴比例为22.5%。行署本级财政仍视同县级财政,实行统一办法。滁县行署的财政收入递增率为7%,包干上缴比例为36.6%;安庆、宣州、宿县、阜阳、六安、巢湖行署和黄山市的财政收入递增率为4%,包干上缴比例为22.5%。

张闫龙(2006)提供了财政包干制时期(1980—1993年)某个省以下财政体制演变的一个案例研究,从中我们可以窥见省以下财政体制的一些有代表性的特征(张闫龙,2006)。根据该项研究,该省与其中一个市政府从1982年开始实行“收支挂钩,总额分成,比例包干”的财政体制,为期4年。具体地说,市级留成收入=当年财政收入×分成比例+(当年财政收入-上年财政收入)×分成比例。通常后一部分的增量分成比例要高于前面的总额分成比例。省市之间主要围绕着这两个分成比例而反复谈判和协商。在具体执行这个体制时,上级政府可能会动用一些相机权力尽量保证本级财力,甚至不惜牺牲下级政府的财政能力。比如省政府与市核定支出范围时,相机少计入一些支出项目,以降低市的分成比例,而在核定收入基数时又人为高估其基数。更关键的是,一些因为中央或上级的规定而新增的支出项目,如军队转业干部的建房费、公检法部门增加人员的费用、增加工资等等,均没有得到相应的财力支持,完全由地方财政买单。1988年之后受中央和省财政体制变化的影响,该省与市的体制又变成“收入递增包干”制,即以1987年财政决算参与分成的收入为基数,每年递增5%;在递增率以内的收入,市留成一个比例(比如14%),超过递增率的收入则全部留给市级政府;但如果达不到递增率的部分,则由市级财力自己补足。每次中央和省级政府的财政体制发生变动,省与市级政府的财政体制也会发生相应的变动,省和市级政府围绕着财权和财力(如留成比例、超收分成比例)的分配问题又将进入新的一轮谈判和协商。

市与县、县与乡的预算内财政收支体制大致参照省与市的预算内体制,比如市与县是采取“收支挂钩、比例包干”的办法,而县与乡采取“核定任务,超收分成”的办法。虽然名称不同,但具体做法非常类似,即首先确定一个下级政府的当年的收入基数,对于这个基数实行一个分成比例,然后,实际收入超出基数的部分则又商定另外一个更高的分成比例。

在两级政府之间商定预算内收支体制时,上级政府总是拥有核定支出项目、收入基数以及决定分成比例的权力。上级政府所掌握的规则设定权,加上政治锦标赛,使得中国的行政体制蕴含了一个压力从上向下传递的机制,即所谓的“压力型体制”(容敬本等,1998)。正像省级政府在面对中央的财政压力时会自然把压力的一部分转嫁给市级政府,市政府在面临省政府的财政压力的时候,又会将这部分压力转移给县财政,市管县的体制正好加强了市对县的财力汲取能力。[^18] 县政府又如法炮制,将财政压力转嫁给乡镇一级。这就是所谓的“财力上收、事权下放”的现象。在分税制之后,当中央拿走财政收入的大头之后,省级政府的财政吃紧,这种现象变得更为严重。

4.5.2 分税制时期

1994年中央决定结束之前运行十几年的“财政包干制”,开始实行分税制改革。中央的分税制改革方案出台后,各省陆续比照中央与省的分税制模式调整了省以下的财政管理体制,但是中央对省以下的财政体制并没有做出具体的规定,各省被赋予了充分的自由裁量权。以中央与地方分享的增值税为例,中央只管分享各省增值税的75%,至于另外25%的增值税如何在省以下的市、县、乡级政府之间分配,中央并没有明文规定。从实际运行来看,在省以下仍然是“财政包干制”,或者说是“财政包干制”与“分税制”的混合。

关于中央与省级政府的分税制国内外学术界进行了大量的研究,然而关于省以下地方政府间的财政关系尚未引起学术界足够的重视,除了少数介绍性的研究外(财政部预算司,2007;贾康和闫坤,2005;张立承,2011),系统的量化分析很少。[^19] 周黎安、吴敏(2015)是这方面的一个尝试,下面我们基于这项研究对中国1994—2012年省、市、县三级财政分成进行一些描述和分析。

分税制推行初期,由于各级政府承担的财政责任不同,地区之间经济发展水平差异悬殊,省以下纵向和横向财力不平衡的现象较为严重,省以下财政体制运行很不顺畅(楼继伟,2013)。省以下财政管理体制也呈现“纷繁复杂”的局面,省以下财政体制处于一个艰难的摸索和适应阶段。2000年前后,各地县乡财政困难的问题集中爆发,地方强烈要求中央出台完善省以下财政管理体制的相关政策。为此,国务院于2002年12月印发了《国务院批转财政部关于完善省以下财政管理体制有关问题意见的通知》(以下简称《通知》),要求各地根据各级政府的财政支出责任以及收入分布结构,合理确定各级政府财政收入占全省财政收入的比重。《通知》要求各地结合实际,采用按税种或按比例分享等规范办法,打破按企业隶属关系划分收入的做法。《通知》还在调节收入差距方面给出了三条指导意见:第一,对于省以下地区间人均财力差距较小的地区,要适当降低省、市级财政收入比重,保证基层财政有稳定的收入来源,调动基层政府组织收入的积极性;第二,省以下地区间人均财力差距较大的地区,要适当提高省、市级财政收入比重,并将因此而增加的收入用于对县、乡的转移支付,调节地区间财政收入差距。第三,省、市级财政不得将因完善体制增加的收入用于提高本级财政支出标准或增加本级财政支出。

各省参照国务院《通知》的指导意见对省以下财政体制进行了相应的调整。截至2006年,除了福建采用的是总额分成制、江苏和浙江采用的是增收分成制外,大多数省对市县采用了分税制的财政体制。但是省以下的分税制并不像中央和各省之间实行的那样清晰明了和“一视同仁”。安徽、山东、湖南等省的分税制中嵌套了“递增上解”、“定额上解”、“增收分成”等“财政包干制”的内容。甘肃、海南等省份对省内经济条件不同的市实行了不同的税收分成政策。

2002年1月开始的所得税收入分享改革也为各地完善省以下财政管理体制提供了契机。根据《国务院关于印发所得税收入分项改革方案的通知》,从2002年1月1日起将按企业隶属关系等划分中央与地方所得税收入的办法改为中央与地方按统一比例分享。中央保证各地区2001年实际的所得税收入基数,实施增量分成。2002年所得税收入中央分享50%,地方分享50%;2003年所得税收入中央分享60%,地方分享40%。《通知》和所得税分享改革之后,各地在2002—2004年间结合实际情况陆续出台了文件,进一步调整和完善了省以下财政管理体制。各省在调整财政管理体制的过程中,逐步建立了较为规范的转移支付制度,政府间收入和支出责任逐渐明晰,较好地调动了各级政府发展经济的积极性。此后,各省的省以下财政体制进入了平稳运行的阶段。

省以下政府间的收入划分形式多种多样,可以说是“一省一式”。截至2006年,各省的财政体制可以概括为“总额分成”、“增收分成”、“分税制”这三种类型。

福建省选择了“总额分成”的财政体制,将设区市级地方一般预算收入的20%作为省级固定分成收入。江苏省和浙江省选择了“增收分成”的财政体制。江苏省2001年规定,以2000年为基期年,核定各市地方财政收入基数和税收返还基数。今后较基数增长部分,省统一集中20%。浙江省2003年出台进一步完善地方财政体制的通知规定,2003年以后,杭州及其他市、县(市)地方财政收入超过2002年收入基数的增量部分,省与市、县(市)实行“二八”分成,即省得20%,市、县(市)得80%。

在实行“分税制”的省份中,有些省只采用了按税种或按比例分成的方式,有些省则在分税制的体制中嵌套了“包干制”的内容。例如山东省2005年下发的关于进一步完善省以下财政管理体制有关问题的通知规定,将济南、淄博、烟台、潍坊、济宁、泰安、威海、日照、莱芜等市的递增上缴比例由5%降为3%。湖南省早在1994年就规定,递增包干地市按原规定继续递增上缴省财政;原实行总额分成的湘潭市,改按以1993年应上缴省财政数额为基数递增上缴。

绝大多数省份对下辖各市的财政体制是“一视同仁”的,但也有个别省份对不同的市采取了不同的政策。例如,在甘肃省增值税的分享办法中,兰州、嘉峪关、金昌、白银、酒泉5个市省级分享70%,市县分享30%;其他市(州、地)省级分享20%,市县分享80%。海南省与市、县的共享收入,省与海口市分享比例为:省分享75%,海口市分享25%;省与其他市、县分享比例为:省分享25%,市、县分享75%。

除规定税收分享比例外,有些省还建立了财政收入增收激励机制。例如,辽宁省对市(不含大连市)在实行5个税种共享体制的基础上,实行增长分成的激励机制。对各市征收的省本级共享收入当年增长幅度超出市一般预算收入增长幅度部分,由省财政给予30%的返还;对当年一般预算收入增幅高于全省平均增幅的市,按增量部分的5%,由省对市通过转移支付给予以奖代补补助。吉林省对市州本级上划省的共享收入,当年增长幅度超出市州本级财政收入增长幅度部分,省财政按超出数额的30%给予返还;对县(市)上划省的共享收入,当年增长幅度超出县(市)财政收入增长幅度部分,省财政按超出数额的40%给予返还。

即使在实行了较为彻底的分税制的省份之间,具体的税收分成办法也是千差万别。尽管中央建议采用按税种或按比例分享的办法,但是省与市县之间按行业、企业隶属关系等划分税收的情况仍然不同程度地存在,而以企业隶属关系划分税收的做法是在中央和省层面进行分税制改革时力图克服的弊端。湖南、宁夏等还单独挑选了某些重点企业的税收收入作为省级固定收入。此外,在江西,省与市县的税收分成比例还与企业的引进方、落户地、是否在工业园区等因素有关。

图4.2分别给出了1995—2012年从中央到省本级、市三级政府一般预算收入分成和支出的比例。[^20] 这里我们将市本级及以下的政府层级统称为“全市”。图4.2(a)描绘了中央、省本级和全市三级政府间的一般预算收入分成情况。1995—2012年省本级分享的一般预算收入基本稳定在11%左右。1997—2004年中央的收入分享比例从49%逐渐上升到55%,随后稳中有降,到2012年下降为48%。各市的收入分享比例则经历了相反的过程,从1997年的41%逐年下降到2004年的34%,随后逐年上升,到2012年上升到42%。图4.2(b)给出了中央、省本级和全市三级政府间一般预算支出的分担情况。省本级分担的支出比例基本稳定在18%左右。以2000年为界,中央分担的支出比例经历了先上升再下降的过程,而各市分担的支出比例则经历了先下降再上升的过程。1995—2000年中央的支出比例从29%上升到35%,各市的支出比例从53%下降到46%。2001—2012年中央的支出比例从31%下降到15%,各市的支出比例则从49%一路上升到69%。

接下来我们考察中央、省本级、市本级、区县四级政府。由于最近年度的数据尚未公开,市本级和区县的数据只到2009年,所以我们进行描述统计的时间区间为1995—2009年。图4.3(a)描绘了四级政府间的收入分成情况,4.3(b)描绘了四级政府间的支出分担情况。中央和省本级的比例和图4.2相同,这里我们重点关注市本级和区县之间的收入分成和支出分担比例。1995—2009年市本级的收入分享比例从17%下降到12%,下降了5个百分点。市本级的支出比例从21%下降到17%,并且2000年之后,支出比例基本稳定在17%左右。各区县分享的收入基本稳定在20%左右,而支出比例则经历了先下降再上升的过程。1995—2000年区县的支出比例从29%下降到27%,2000年以后该比例逐年上升。到2009年,区县的支出比例达到了42%。

图4.4描绘了1998—2007年中央、省本级、市本级、区县四级政府间增值税的分成比例。从图中可以看出,与前后年份相比,2004年的分成比例较为异常。我们结合数据情况和制度背景分析后认为,这可能是由于2004年出口退税负担机制改革所致。为了建立中央和地方共同负担出口退税的新机制,中央决定从2004年开始以2003年出口退税实退数额为基数,对超基数部分的应退税额,由中央和地方按75∶25的比例共同负担。然而该方案导致地区分担不均衡,部分地区负担较重,一些地方甚至出台限制外购产品出口、限制引进出口型外资项目等措施。于是中央决定自2005年1月1日起,超基数部分中央与地方按照92.5∶7.5的比例共同负担。[^21]

除了2004年之外,中央始终分享全部增值税收入的77%左右,之所以略大于我们通常所说的75%是因为海关代征的增值税等是中央的固定收入。省本级分享的增值税比例大约稳定在6%,市本级分享的增值税比例大约稳定在8%,2005年之后略有下降。区县分享的增值税比例大约稳定在10%,2005年之后略有上升。

图4.5描绘了1998—2007年中央、省本级、市本级、区县四级政府间营业税的分成比例。1998—2001年中央平均每年分享全国营业税的15%,2001年之后中央分享的营业税比例逐渐降低,2003年以后该比例基本稳定在3%—4%。省本级的分享比例基本稳定在30%左右,2005年之后该比例略有上升。到2007年,省本级营业税的分享比例为33%。1999—2007年市本级分享的营业税比例经历了先上升再下降的过程,1999—2003年市本级营业税的分享比例从25%上升到28%,但2004—2007年该比例从27%下降到23%。区县分享的营业税比例从1998年的24%逐年上升到2007年的41%。

图4.6描绘了2001—2007年中央、省本级、市本级、区县四级政府间企业所得税的分成比例。在所得税分享改革还未进行的2001年,中央分享了企业所得税收入的40%,2002年中央分享了企业所得税收入的65%。所得税分享改革之后,其他三级政府企业所得税的分享比例比较稳定。省本级分享的企业所得税比例基本稳定在15%左右。市本级分享的企业所得税比例基本稳定在8%左右。区县政府企业所得税比例基本稳定在10%左右。

图4.7描绘了2001—2007年中央、省本级、市本级、区县四级政府间个人所得税的分成比例。2001年中央分享了个人所得税收入的33%,2002年分享了54%,2003—2007年的分享比例一直维持在65%左右。省本级政府在2001年分享了11%,2002年分享了18%,2003年之后分享比例基本稳定在12%左右。市本级政府在2001年分享了22%,2002年分享了13%,此后该比例稳定在10%左右。区县政府在2001年分享了33%,2002年分享了15%,此后分享比例稳定在13%左右。

我们最后再对中国行政体制中最基层的乡镇财政做一些简要的讨论。乡镇随着人民公社的解体,乡镇政权被重新确立,乡镇财政也逐步建立起来。1985年国家财政部根据中央关于建立乡级财政的精神,颁发了《乡(镇)财政管理试行办法》,规定乡镇财政必须贯彻“统一领导、分级管理”的原则。乡镇财政收入和支出由国家预算内资金、预算外资金和自筹资金组成。80年代后期,全国范围内推行财政包干体制。

乡镇政府的收入包括三个部分。首先是财政预算内收入,来自各类税收(如农业税、特产税、牲畜屠宰税)和上级的补助收入;其次是预算外收入,有各种行政事业性收费和集资,包括村提留(此项实际属于村级收入,但是由乡镇统一分配征收)、乡统筹和共同生产费用(即用于抗旱排涝和其他公益性的生产支出资金);再次是自筹资金,包括乡镇企业的利润和提成。这里直接向农民摊派的有农业税、特产税、牲畜屠宰税、三项提留、五项统筹、共同生产费和代征的其他费用。

乡镇政府的支出(不包括返还村级的三项提留)包括以下几个部分,上缴财政的资金(也叫体制上缴部分),代有关部门收取的费用,乡镇干部职工(包括教师)的工资支出,专项(五项统筹)支出、偿还债务利息等。在这些支出中,上缴部分、专项支出、工资支出、列支列收部分、三项提留都属于支出刚性较大的项目,如果税收收入无法满足,就必须挤占共同生产费和五项统筹,包括教育附加。如果仍然不够,就只有举债度日,甚至拖欠工资。

特别值得注意的一点是乡镇政府对于上缴财政资金的义务和责任。乡镇向县政府的体制上缴部分是由财政税务部门和乡政府征收的两部分进行综合体制结账,但上缴任务的完成情况是由乡镇政府负全部责任。乡镇如果不能完成上缴任务,即使责任在税务机关(如征收不力或短收),那么乡镇也必须补足余额,一个办法就是从应该下拨的中央转移支付部分和体制下划部分中如数扣除,这叫“垫底”或者“贴税”。[^22] 乡镇的税务机关(国税、地税和财政所)的人、财、物均由县级政府解决和控制,乡镇政府根本无权过问,但它们税收征收的缺口却由乡镇政府完全负责,这说明乡镇政府在行政事务发包链条中处于非常弱势的地位。

从90年代中期以来县乡财政问题日益凸现,乡镇财政负荷(财政空转)和政府负债问题已经积累到非常严重的地步。与此相联系,农民负担也日益加重,农民和乡村干部的冲突加剧,农民群体性抗争事件不断增多。一些学者把农村集中出现的这一系列问题归为农村基层普遍出现了“治理性危机”的产物。[^23] 三农问题、县乡行政体制改革、村民选举和自治问题在这个大的背景下纷纷被提上议事日程。

虽然社会舆论和学界把矛头直指乡镇政府官员,但我们需要问的一个基本问题是,为什么农民负担问题和乡镇体制改革问题近年来变得如此严重?是什么条件的变化使得它日益恶化?乡镇干部与农民的关系如何从合作变成冲突?这里涉及的三农问题是否存在地区差异?从地区差异中我们能看到什么?因此,我们需要从历史演变的角度考察这些问题的发展轨迹,否则,我们无法把握其中的核心原因。

粗略的观察似乎表明,县乡财政困难和农民负担加重有两个原因起了关键性的作用。一是乡镇企业的最终衰落和转型,乡村集体的财政实力受到重创,与此同时,农民失去了分享工业化利益的机会。全国乡镇企业就业由1996年的1.35亿减为2001年的1.28亿人,这种就业下降情况在中部传统农业区更为突出。在此期间,农民从传统农业中所得到的纯收入却一再下降。对于传统农区来说,维持收入缓慢增长的主要来源是外出打工(陈锡文,2002)。与县域工商业增长滞缓、乡镇企业困顿相伴随的一个突出现象是乡村债务的迅速积累。

二是分税制改革,中央和省级政府实行分税制,使财政资源大幅度向中央倾斜,但省以下仍然实行财政包干制,向中央倾斜资源的压力不得不逐级向下,最终落到了县乡基层政府,这是压力型体制的缘起(容敬本等,1998)。自分税制改革以来,在全国财政形势出现好转的背景下,许多地区的县乡财政却陷入了困境。在一般情况下,乡级政府比县级政府更为困难,这是压力型体制的一个基本特征,即资源由下级向上级集中,而责任和压力向下级政府转移。[^24] 为了完成上级政府的财政增收任务,保住“乌纱帽”,乡镇政府不得不向农民摊派和加征,导致农民怨声载道。一些地区的基层政府入不敷出,由“吃饭”财政变成了“讨饭”财政(陈锡文,2002,第17页)。事实上,许多所谓的税费征收是乡镇干部在上级部门的压力下进行的,征收的很大一部分也被上级部门收走了。农民负担太重的责任不能完全算在乡镇干部的贪婪和失职上,它是许多因素综合造成的,其中有行政体制传递财政压力的原因。在人民公社时期,公社干部的工资和办公经费由县财政拨款,县和公社的财政关系是“统收统支”,公社只能在上级规定的范围内开支,不允许向社员收费和摊派。农村修建基础设施,办学校和盖医院,经费都是上级财政拨款,不向农民征收杂费。那时一个公社的全部党政工作人员只有20—30人。

县乡财政困难的问题,尤其中西部欠发达地区基层政府财力紧张的问题,引起了社会的高度关注。2000年以来中央陆续推出了一系列措施和政策,以帮助这些困难地区的地方政府增加财力,提高基本公共服务的水平。2005年起,中央对各困难县实行“三奖一补”政策,即对财政困难县政府增加本级税收收入和省市级政府增加对财政困难县财力性转移支付给予奖励,对县乡政府精简机构和人员给予奖励,对产粮大县按照粮食商品量、粮食产量、粮食播种面积等因素和各自权重计算给予奖励,对以前缓解县乡财政困难工作做得好的地区给予补助的政策。该政策的亮点是“以奖代补”,鼓励困难县增加财政收入,尤其鼓励省市增加对困难县的转移支付,实现省市范围内基本公共服务的均等化。

与此同时,省以下财政体制开始引入“省直管县”和“乡财县管”的改革。所谓“省直管县”,就是省级财政在政府间收支划分、转移支付、资金往来、预决算、年终结算等方面,与市、县财政直接联系,原来市与县之间日常的资金往来关系被取消。原有的“市管县”体制带来了两个问题:一是所谓的“市刮县”,即市级政府截留、克扣上级转移下来给县政府的资金,或者从较发达的辖县“搜刮”资源和财力,导致后者怨声载道;二是在“市管县”体制之下,市的经济发展水平和财力状况直接决定了它在辖区内的转移支付和财力再分配的能力,进而决定了所辖区县公共服务的差距大小。“省直管县”有助于克服以前“市刮县”的问题,同时强化省级政府转移支付功能,更好地实现省内基本公共服务的均等化。各地推行改革的侧重点有所不同。浙江、湖北、安徽、吉林等省实行更为彻底的改革,在财政体制的制定、转移支付和专款的分配、财政结算、收入报解、资金调度、债务管理等财政管理的各个方面,全面实行省对县的直接管理。而山西、辽宁、河南等省对转移支付、专款分配,以及资金调度等涉及省对县补助资金分配的方面实行省直接管理。也有省市共管的情况,如山东、广西,即省级财政在分配转移支付等补助资金时,直接核定到县,但在分配和资金调度时仍以省对市、市对县方式办理。同时省级财政加强对县级监管。[^25]

“乡财县管”是指县级财政部门直接管理并监督乡镇财政收支,实行县乡“预算共编、账户统设、集中收支、采购统办、票据统管”的财政管理方式。该项改革主要针对90年代以来日益严重的乡镇财力紧张、人员和债务膨胀的问题,在不改变乡镇“三权”(即预算管理权不变、资金所有权和使用权不变、财务审批权不变)的前提下,实施综合财政预算,集中和加强乡镇收入管理,控制和约束乡镇支出需求,统一和规范乡镇财务核算,遏制和缩减乡镇债务规模。在预算编制上县级财政部门强调“保工资、保运转、保重点、保稳定”的原则,优先保证人员工资(如乡村教师的工资)正常发放和机构正常运转,并向农业、教育、卫生、社会保障等领域倾斜。推进乡财县管改革,有利于减轻农民负担和缓解乡镇财政困难,控制乡镇债务规模的膨胀。截至2011年底,全国实行乡财县管的乡镇2.93万个,约占全国乡镇总数的85%(楼继伟,2013)。

行政发包制下的财政分成和预算包干所秉承的理念是“靠山吃山,靠水吃水”,“八仙过海,各显神通”,基层政府在支出责任和财力上成为“剩余索取者”,支出水平高度依赖于经费自筹。其好处是各地政府面临较强的财政激励,提高财源汲取能力,弊端是各层级、各地区政府财政负担的纵向和横向不平等,最终体现为各地公共服务水平差距悬殊。“省直管县”和“乡财县管”的改革是对行政发包制的一个重要偏离,通过提升财政预算管理的层次,一方面有助于规范化预算管理制度和政府收支行为,另一方面有助于在更高层次上加大转移支付力度,减少财政负担的纵向和横向不平等,实现基本公共服务的均等化。

# 5 政治锦标赛

解释中国经济奇迹需要回答的一个根本性的问题是:在政治体制上,中国改革前后一直保持了政治集权的模式,那么为什么同一个或类似的政治体制下存在如此不同的经济增长绩效?中国的改革开放究竟改变了什么基本条件使得地方政府的行为如此不同?

我们前面提到,“中国特色的联邦主义”理论认为,导致中国地方政府的强激励有两个基本原因,第一个是行政性分权,第二个是以财政包干为内容的财政分权改革。虽然行政与财政的地方分权确实构成地方政府激励的重要来源,但是否构成中国地方政府内部激励最持久和最基本的力量,这是值得进一步推敲和讨论的。[^1] 过去三十年中央和地方的行政、经济管理权限和财政分配一直处于变动和调整之中,在大多数场合这些调整直接有损于地方政府的利益,但地方政府推动经济增长的热情并没有受到明显的影响,这说明地方政府的行为背后还有一种超越行政与财政分权的、更基本的激励力量存在。“中国特色的联邦主义”假说(包括张五常的“县际竞争”理论)的一个重要假设是地方政府试图追求财政收入的最大化。这个假设在中国的制度背景下存在一个隐含的问题:地方政府追求财政收入最大化的微观基础是什么?它如何与地方官员个体的激励发生关联?财政收入不等于官员自己的收入,官员为什么要关心它的规模大小?如果一个地方官员即将卸任,他还会关心政府所能支配的财政收入吗?为了更好地理解中国地方政府对于财政收入的追求,我们需要一个更微观的理论视角。

本章试图说明,地方官员之间围绕区域经济发展绩效而进行的“政治锦标赛”模式是理解官员激励、政府治理与经济增长的关键线索之一。政治锦标赛在一个多层级的政府结构中推行和实施,人事权的集中是其实施的基本前提之一。而政治锦标赛本身可以将关心仕途和晋升的地方政府官员置于强力的激励之下,因此政治锦标赛是与将政治集权与强激励兼容在一起的政府治理和激励模式。它的运行不依赖于政治体制的巨大变化,但是我们后面的分析将表明,政治锦标赛运作的游戏规则(如考核奖惩标准与力度)和制度环境(如参与人是否有退出权)对于政治锦标赛的作用效果会产生极为重要的影响。

## 5.1 定义、特征和实施条件

我们所定义的政治锦标赛是指处于同一级别的政府官员为了获得政治晋升而相互竞争的博弈,也称为“晋升锦标赛”(周黎安,2004,2007)。作为一种“官场竞争”,政治锦标赛既可以发生在同一级别但分属不同辖区的地方官员之间,也可以在一个政府部门不同科室的同级官员之间,但目前的研究更侧重于前一种情况。[^2] 在这种晋升竞赛中,竞赛优胜者将获得提拔,而竞赛优胜的标准则由上级政府决定,它可以是GDP增长率,也可以是其他可度量的指标,如财政收入增长率、招商引资的数量或排污的减少量。政治锦标赛作为一种激励和治理手段绝非改革开放以来的发明,它内嵌于中国两千多年的官僚体制之中。在改革之前的毛泽东时代就经常被使用,如50年代的合作化运动、“大跃进”时期各省市竞相就粮食产量大放“卫星”以及人民公社化运动,都借助了政治锦标赛这个激励模式,层层动员,层层加码。“粮食放卫星”和“大炼钢铁”就是各级地方官员为显示政治效忠而竞相提出高指标的结果(周飞舟,2009;Fan et al.,2014)。在中国的不同历史时期,政治锦标赛所改变的是考核标准和形式以及官场竞争的环境和形态,由此造成的官员激励和行为也就有所不同。[^3]

提出政治锦标赛这个概念的核心意义在于,强调政府官员所处官场的竞争性质如何塑造官员激励和行为,进而对经济和社会的重要影响。在此之前,学者更多是研究地方政府之间的竞争或者地方政府的财税激励,如钱颖一等人的“中国特色财政联邦主义”和张五常的“县际竞争”理论,分析的聚焦点都在于地方政府,而且视地方政府为经济代理人,主要关心财政收入最大化。政治锦标赛将官员个体置于分析的焦点位置,突出晋升激励的意义,为我们分析地方政府的行为和现象、打开地方政府这个黑箱奠定了重要的微观基础。按照这个视角,所有影响官场竞争的因素(如晋升标准、竞争程度的变化),所有影响官员晋升的因素(如官员的年龄、任期、职位),都将影响官员激励和行为的变化,进而影响地方政府的政策制定和实施效果。官场竞争、官员特征与地区经济发展之间就由此建立了一一对应关系,如同“函数映射”关系一样。这是政治锦标赛理论所带来的、区别于现存文献的新视角和新分析。在后面的章节,我们将借助政治锦标赛这个分析框架,从官场竞争和市场竞争互动的视角(即“官场+市场”理论)解释官员激励与中国经济之间的内在关联以及中国特色的市场经济如何运行。

在中国,地方官员之间的政治锦标赛采取了多层级、逐级淘汰的程序。中国行政体制由中央、省、市(地区)、县和乡镇五级政府构成,政治锦标赛可以发生在地方政府层面上同一级别、同一官场的地方官员之间,而中国“以块为主”的行政管理体制在不同层次上的同构性使得政治锦标赛得以多层级、多区域同时推行。比如说,如果在省一级干部之间采取以GDP为基础的锦标赛竞争的话,那么省级官员就必须提供较高的GDP增长水平。为此,他们可能会在辖区内的市一级推行GDP锦标赛竞争,而市又会在县一级推行锦标赛竞争,如此一层一层地往下推进。这里我们不仅看到一个层级的地方政府如何跨地区相互竞争,还看到不同层级的地方官员的激励如何相互影响,由此可以进一步理解中国各层级区域经济的经济增长情况。

从职务晋升路径来说,地方官员从最低的行政职位一步一步提拔,进入一个典型的逐级淘汰的锦标赛结构。[^4] 它的最大特征是,进入下一轮的选手必须是上一轮的优胜者,每一轮被淘汰出局的选手就自动失去下一轮参赛的资格。比如说县长因为某种原因没有获得提升,退居二线,或者直接退休了,或者被罢免了,那么,他(她)就不可能再进行下一轮更高职位(如市长和省长)的竞争,这就是逐级淘汰。为了进入下一轮,每一位参与人必须在本轮获胜才有资格。这样就给地方官员施加了很大的压力,形成一种非常残酷的晋升竞争。[^5] 更关键的是,中央对每一级别的行政干部的任职都有最高年龄的限制,实行强制退休制,所以从政者必须在一定年龄升到某个级别,否则就永远失去进一步晋升的机会了。假设一个任期的时间正常为5年,那么一个新涉足仕途的年轻人要逐级提升为副省部级干部,必须逐级提升到科级、处级和厅级的职位(中间还包括副科级、副处级、副厅级这样通常不能省略的阶梯),在最顺利的情况下一般需要大约35年的时间,但通常来说远不止这些时间,在升为副省部级干部之前绝大多数人已经接近或超过60岁,到了强制退休的年龄。所以从基层开始要晋升到省部级干部通常要走“快车道”,或者起点比较高,而大多数人则在中间的某个仕途阶梯就止步不前了。

然而,对于中国的地方官员来说,强制退休年龄还不是最可怕的约束,最可怕的约束是官员在达到正式退休年龄之前还有一个“退居二线”的年龄。地方领导干部达到一定年龄就要“退居二线”,这是很多地方的普遍现象。[^6] 所谓领导干部退居二线,是指担任实职的领导干部达到一定年龄,按组织部门的要求不再担任实职领导职务,改任非领导职位继续工作或赋闲在家,但仍然享有原领导职务职级的工资福利待遇,达到退休年龄时再办理退休手续。比如副省(部)级官员正式退休年龄是60岁,如果一个副省级干部未到退休年龄,但已经过了58岁,他(她)就很可能要去人大或政协,无法再继续担任政府核心位置的实职;但如果是57岁或更年轻,则可以继续担任一线的职位,这就是过去长期流行的所谓的“七上八下”的人事惯例。对于副省级是“七上八下”,那么对于正厅级官员,过了55—56岁,不仅晋升机会很少了,退居二线就变得很可能了。以此类推,那些副厅级和正处级的官员则要面临更加年轻的“退居二线”的年龄。四十岁进入县委班子已经年龄偏大了,四十五岁则是超年龄了(赵树凯,2010,第158页)。中国官场竞争的激烈程度可见一斑。

对于很多官员来说,错过一轮提拔机会,因为年龄的原因,就可能永远失去晋升机会,这势必影响到地方官员的晋升策略和行为激励。比如一些地方官员可能采取“铤而走险”的冒险策略,甚至产生“加塞”和走捷径的念头,近年来较为盛行的“跑官买官”现象在一定程度上是官场激烈竞争的一个后果。行政干部任职路径和年龄限制的一些微小变化都会引起巨大的连锁反应,并最终影响到政府官员的激励和行为。[^7] 从这个意义上说,如何满足地方官员参与晋升竞赛的参与约束,让他们有足够的激励“走正道”不走“邪道”,有作为而不尸位素餐,是政治锦标赛机制设计的一个巨大挑战。

长期以来中国政府官员处于一个相对封闭的“内部劳动力市场”,即一旦被上级领导罢免、开除,就很难在组织外部找到其他工作,作为官员个人也不能自由退出已有的职位。仕途内外的巨大落差产生一种很强的“锁定”效应,造成一旦进入官场就必须努力保住职位并争取一切可能的晋升机会。其效果非常类似于日本企业终身雇佣制下的内部劳动力市场:一个雇员跳槽离开企业被外部市场认为是一个坏的信号,说明这个雇员能力有问题,致使雇员难以跨企业流动,而不得不在企业内部努力寻求晋升(Aoki,1988)。近些年来,随着中国市场经济的发展,干部“下海”的情况逐渐增多,“锁定”效应才有所变弱。但是,对于大多数官员来说,一旦进入了政府部门,基本上就终身“被锁定”了,到外部求职的机会并不多。

改革开放以来政治锦标赛的最实质性的变化是考核标准的变化。地方主政官任期内的经济绩效取代了过去的政治效忠,成为决定晋升的一项重要指标。这种转变的契机是党的十一届三中全会以来拨乱反正和全党工作重心从阶级斗争转向经济建设。经济改革和发展成为各级党委和政府的头等大事,经济绩效也就成了干部晋升考核的主要指标之一。上世纪80年代初邓小平提出了党和国家领导制度改革的重要思想,包括强调干部队伍的年轻化、知识化和专业化,鼓励老干部的离休退休,引入任期制和年龄限制。1984年中央决定适当下放干部管理权限,确定了下管一级的干部管理体制,使得省级政府可以通过人事任命权对市级政府发动经济竞赛,市级政府可以促使县级政府竞争,以此类推。这一系列举措均为改革开放以来新型的政治锦标赛奠定了重要的制度基础。

日常观察的一系列现象和基于微观数据的实证证据均指向以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛模式在中国的广泛性。从日常观察来看,GDP显然是地方官员最为关切的指标之一。中国是世界范围内唯一发布国家、省、市、县四级GDP统计的国家,这些数据的统计为考察各级地方官员的经济绩效提供了重要参考。长期以来GDP和财政收入的增长被地方官看做是反映其政绩的“硬指标”,是各级地方政府每年发布的《政府工作报告》必然涉及的最重要的数字。中国地方官员非常热衷于GDP和相关经济指标的排名,在他们介绍辖区经济发展情况时最爱援引的数据之一就是在省内或市内的GDP、财政收入等指标的相对排名。由国家统计局主持的“中国百强县排名”曾经持续了九年,非常引人关注,后来因为有人抨击这个排名过于强调GDP增长、忽略了其他社会发展的重要方面而中止了,但很快民间又发起了同样的“中国百强县排名”。与此相联系的,当上级政府提出某个经济发展指标(如GDP增长率),下级政府就会竞相提出更高的发展指标,出现层层分解、层层加码的现象。比如在全国的“十一五”规划中,年均经济增长率预期目标设定为7.5%,而在全国31个省市公布的“十一五”规划中,预计平均GDP增速却是10.1%,最高的达13%,最低为8.5%,以至于国家发改委紧急发文要求各省市为GDP增长“减速”。[^8] 这种“上有所好,下必甚焉”的现象事实上是中国行政体制的一个非常普遍的现象,类似的事情在许多著述中均有记载。

最近以来,反对以GDP论英雄的绩效观成为中央领导反复强调的重要观点。从最近的领导讲话、官方文件和新闻报道中,我们可以看到中共中央要求各级地方政府考核党政领导不再以GDP为主要指标,如2013年11月5日十八届三中全会习近平总书记多次强调的“我们不再简单以国内生产总值增长率论英雄”,“更不要为生产总值增长率、全国排位等纠结”;2013年12月经中共中央批准、中央组织部印发的《关于改进地方党政领导班子和领导干部政绩考核工作》,明确规定不能仅仅把地区生产总值及增长速度作为考核评价政绩的主要指标,不能搞地区生产总值及增长率排名,地方各级党委政府不能单纯以地区生产总值及增长率排名评定下一级领导班子和领导干部的政绩和考核等次。2014年1月新华网也再次指明不要再进行GDP竞赛。这些领导人讲话、官方文件和媒体报道都从一个侧面说明,地方官员围绕GDP增长的竞争并不只是一种理论的猜测,而是在很多地区流行多年、趋于极端化的具体实践。

在政治锦标赛的经验证据方面,Maskin等(2001)考察了按照排名计算的相对经济绩效与官员升迁可能性之间的关系,他们利用1976年至1986年省级官员的数据发现,各省的经济增长率在全国排名的提高会显著增加每百万人口中央委员的数量。Li和Zhou(2005)以及周黎安等(2005)给出了系统的官员政治锦标赛的经验证据,发现辖区内更快的GDP增长会显著增加官员升迁的概率,并且升迁概率还取决于以前任官员为基准的相对绩效。周飞舟(2009)从政治体制的角度出发,说明中央集权导致锦标赛体制成为必然,地方官员的锦标赛体制不仅仅存在于改革开放之后,在“大跃进”时期就存在。杜兴强等(2011)采用经济增长率的加速度,王贤彬等(2011)采用现任官员与1978年以来至本任官员的GDP平均增长率的相对绩效,重新考察省级官员与省区经济绩效的关系,发现了两者之间的正向关系。Choi(2012)为省级官员的政治锦标赛机制提供了进一步的经验证据。乔坤元(2013a)给出了官员政治锦标赛的理论基础,并且从先验和后验两个方面使用省级官员的数据说明,以经济绩效为核心的官员政治锦标赛机制是存在的。乔坤元(2013b)还使用省市两级政府的官员数据发现锦标赛机制自上而下竞争程度逐渐升级的特点。

周黎安等(2005)还发现,中央在考核省级官员的绩效时不仅关注辖区内绝对的GDP增长速度,而且还要参考省级领导前任的平均增长绩效以及周边地区GDP增长的情况,理性地运用相对绩效评估的方法来减少绩效考核的误差,增加其可能的激励效果。Wu等(2013)使用地级市数据发现书记和市长相对于前任的GDP增长率越高,晋升概率越高。Landry等(2015)考虑了省、市、县三级地方官员与同期其他同级官员的相对经济绩效(即GDP和财政收入增长),发现相对经济绩效对晋升的正面作用随着行政层级下降而增大,也就是说,市、县官员围绕着GDP和财税增长的晋升竞争最为激烈。

如何选择合理的方法从官员所在辖区的经济绩效识别官员真正的能力和贡献,剔除那些外部因素(如宏观性和区域性)的影响,是政治锦标赛正常发挥作用的一个关键。上述实证研究显示,官员任期内的平均绩效(Li and Zhou,2005)、相对于前任的绩效(周黎安等,2005;Wu et al.,2013)、相对于同期其他竞争对手的绩效(Landry et al.,2015)比官员当期自己的绩效更显著地提高晋升的概率。但是,这些绩效评估都是基于一个地方领导在一个辖区内的绩效,不少地方领导可能在多个地区任职,多个地区任职的经济绩效比单个地区的绩效更能反映该领导的执政能力。Yao和Zhang(2015)基于这个事实,利用1994—2010年25个省区的地级市数据,首先由多期GDP增长绩效估计市委书记、市长的“执政能力”,然后看这个估计的“执政能力”对晋升的影响。该研究发现,由多期绩效反映的“执政能力”显著提高了晋升的概率,而且它的影响随着官员年龄增大而增大。所有这些研究从一个侧面说明,在官员绩效评估过程中,组织部门确实在综合多个角度评估官员的真实绩效,而非简单地以官员在一个辖区的短期、单独的绩效进行评判;这样做的目的是为了保证锦标赛的公平性,最大化政治锦标赛的激励效应。

还有一些间接证据支持政治锦标赛在现实中的重要性。Yu 等(2016)使用中国地级市的数据,发现全社会固定资产投资的空间竞争效应所呈现的特征与官员政治锦标赛假说相一致,而与标尺竞争、空间溢出效应或税收竞争等假说相左。基于五年规划和年度经济增长目标的研究,周黎安等(2015)发现从第七个五年计划开始到“十二五”结束,这个期间经济增长目标平均说来省高于中央,市高于省,县高于市,出现极为显著的“层层加码”特征。然而,2013年以来中央强调“淡化GDP”考核,增长目标的“层层加码”程度则明显减弱了(Li et al.,2016)。还有证据表明,政府目标的“层层加码”现象主要存在于GDP增长和固定资产增长率这些经济绩效指标,而在计划生育、环境保护方面则不明显,这个实证结果有力地说明了各级地方政府关于GDP增长的“显示偏好”(王梓雄、周黎安,2015)。

当然,影响官员晋升的因素是多方面的,除了经济绩效,年龄、政治关联、人脉等因素也可能影响晋升的结果。Li和Zhou(2005)就发现,其他条件不变,省级官员的中央工作经历对晋升有着显著的影响。Yao和Zhang(2015)在地级市官员上有类似发现,省级部门的工作经历对地级市官员的晋升有正向影响。Shih等(2012)设计了更为全面的政治关联测度(如同事、同乡关系)发现了政治关联对于官员晋升的显著影响。进一步的研究表明,即使在政治关联发生作用的时候,经济绩效也是重要的,Jia等(2015)利用省级官员数据发现经济绩效与政治关联在影响晋升上是互补关系,Landry等(2015)发现地方政府层级越低,政治关联的作用越小,经济绩效的作用越大。

政治锦标赛不是在任何一种政治体制下都可以发挥充分效力的,它至少需要以下几个技术和制度条件。第一,上级政府的人事任命权必须是集中的,它可以决定晋升和提拔的具体标准和操作规程,并根据下级政府官员的考核绩效决定升迁。第二,存在一种具体可量化的竞赛指标,如GDP增长率、财政收入、出口创汇量,委托人和代理人均可观察到。围绕单一可量化指标的锦标赛竞争激励效应最大,但如果考核标准是基于一些模糊和主观的判断,或者代理人面对一组多指标体系(最后取决于综合评估结果),那么锦标赛的激励效应就会相应地削弱。尤其当主观评价夹杂太多任意性和变动性的时候,更是如此。第三,委托人必须信守承诺,公正、严格地执行事前宣布的考核指标和程序考核、选拔和任免政府代理人。委托人对于具体实施晋升标准的可置信承诺也是极为关键的。如果作为裁判方的委托人在具体评选优胜者的时候偏离其最初宣布的比赛指标和晋升标准,让一些其他与“赛场竞争”无关的因素介入其中,这种锦标赛自然无法取信于人,参与人也不会认真参与比赛,而是想方设法去拉关系,或者干脆就跑官买官。第四,各参赛主体,即政府官员的“竞赛成绩”是相对可分离、可识别和可比较的。如果大家是团队作业,各成员彼此分工协作,个人的绩效无法单独衡量,那自然就分不出个人之间的优劣好坏。第五,参赛的政府官员能够在相当程度上控制和影响最终考核的绩效,这主要涉及考核指标与参赛人的努力之间是否存在足够显著的关联,如果关联度太弱,激励效果会很有限。最后,参与人之间不容易形成合谋。[^9] 可以设想,如果所有参赛人私下合谋,大家都保持相同成绩(比如大家都偷懒),那么大家就都成了胜者,平分最高奖,或以相同的概率得到晋升,这肯定有损于委托人的利益。集体合谋偷懒主要发生在锦标赛的优胜者与非优胜者的奖励差异不大的场合。当两者差异足够大时,单个参与人会产生偏离合谋的激励,最终使得合谋瓦解。

要同时满足上述这些条件并不容易。举例来说,Besley和Coate(1995) 利用美国州级水平的数据研究美国州长之间是否存在一种标尺竞争(yardstick competition)。在他们的模型中,选民是委托人,州长是代理人,选民以邻近州的税率和其他经济指标作为基准来判断他们所在州的州长是否胜任,从而在下次竞选时决定是否支持连任。这里的政治竞争似乎也可以看作是由选民发动的州长之间的政治锦标赛,只是这里的晋升变成了连任。但是,这个模型与真正的政治锦标赛还是有很大的距离。首先,选民的偏好各不相同,众口难调,相对可度量的税率只是其中的一个方面,这里既不存在集中的人事权,也不存在一个统一且大家公认的绩效标准决定州长的政治命运。[^10] 其次,州长的许多经济决策(如税率的设定)并非可以独立做出,州议会在其中的作用可能更大,上述的第四个条件也不满足。即使存在所谓的标尺竞争,由于州长无法直接控制或影响选民关心的税率和其他方面,对州长的激励效果也是要打折扣的。

中国具备一些特殊的政治与经济条件,适合采用政治锦标赛作为一种官员激励模式。第一,中国是中央集权的国家,中央或上级政府决定下级政府官员的任命,即具有集中的人事权。第二,自改革开放以来,党和国家的工作重心转向以经济建设为中心,历届政府都把经济发展当作第一要务,经济发展被置于各级政府工作的重中之重,这为各级政府实施以经济发展为核心考核指标的晋升竞争提供了最为重要的组织和路线保证。GDP和财税增长等相关经济指标比较容易从统计部门获得,相关各方也都可以大致观察到一个地区经济增长的状况。第三,在中国,无论是省与省之间,还是在市(地区)、县、乡之间有很大的同构性和相似性,所以这些区域主政官的经济绩效是可比的。这使得政治锦标赛的第四个条件得以满足。这种可比性得益于中国从计划经济时代就已显出端倪的M型经济结构,省区之间相互独立且自给自足,而苏联的U型经济结构使得各地区更多是经济协作和分工关系,区域之间的经济绩效难以比较(Qian and Xu,1993;Maskin et al.,2001)。在中国目前的行政体制下,地方官员对地方经济发展具有巨大的影响力和控制力,一些最重要的资源,如行政审批、土地批租、贷款担保、政策优惠等等均掌握在地方政府的手中,因而满足第五个条件。最后,跨地区的地方政府官员之间的合谋在中国目前的晋升体制下不是一个现实的威胁,地方官员之间的高度竞争才是常态。原因在于,晋升与不晋升存在巨大的利益差异,不仅表现为行政权力和地位的巨大差异,而且在政治前景上也不可同日而语:不晋升可能意味着失去下一轮的竞争资格,甚至彻底出局,而晋升意味着未来进一步的晋升机会增加。

上述关于西方背景下的“标尺竞争”与中国政治锦标赛的区别在我和合作者最近的一项实证研究中得以验证(Yu et al., 2016)。这项研究利用2000—2005年300多个地级市的官员(市长和书记)和地区经济数据发现,地级市之间的社会固定资产投资存在显著的正向空间关联效应,即一个地级市的投资增加会与另外一些地级市投资的增加产生联动效应。进一步分析表明,地级市投资的这些空间关联效应主要反映在一个省区范围之内,两个省的交界市之间则不存在这种空间效应。对于同一个省内的地级市,只有那些经济规模比较接近的地区空间效应比较显著,而非地理上相邻的地区。我们还把这些地区间的空间效应与官员特征联系起来考察,发现当地级市官员的年龄在56岁之前空间效应比较显著,而过了56岁之后这些效应就大幅度下降,且在统计上也不显著。这些实证研究的结果充分说明了西方意义上的标尺竞争在中国并不重要,正是政治锦标赛导致了地区间投资变动的空间效应。这是因为投资的空间效应主要出现在同一官场(同一省区的地级市之间的官员处于同一官场,而不同省区的地级市官员之间不在一个官场竞争)、具有可比性的地方官员之间(并非地理相邻而是经济规模相近的地区之间),这与中国式政治锦标赛的具体实践是一致的,空间效应的强弱与官员退居二线年龄的关联性则进一步支持了我们的结论。

为了保证政治锦标赛的有效进行,如何选择参赛人的规模和确定参赛组的成员构成极为关键。当我们说同一级别的地方官员处于政治锦标赛之下,并不意味着所有同级的地方官员都应该属于“竞争对手”。处于同一个官场的竞争人数之多少必须考虑官员参与竞争的激励(即参与约束),不是参与人越多、竞争越激烈就越好。事实上,给定晋升职位是固定的,参与竞争的人数越多,晋升的几率越小,参加锦标赛的期望收入越低,参与人的竞争激励越低。为了保证参与人有适当的激励水平,同一组内的竞争者人数不能太多。当然参与人数太少,竞争不激烈,也不利于调动参与者比赛的积极性。因此,在把政治锦标赛作为主要激励模式的情况下,一级政府所辖的下级政府的数目必须在一个合理的规模区间,过大和过小均不利于调动参与人的积极性。政治锦标赛的优化设计必然内生地决定一个政府组织的层级结构,如一个省所辖的市(地区)的数目,一个市(地区)所辖的县的数目等等。

上面的讨论假定参与人是同质的。如果考虑到参与人的异质性,如何最优确定参赛组成人员的结构就变得非常重要了。中国幅员广阔,各地历史地理和经济发展条件差异非常之大,将一些并不属于“同一起跑线”的地区放在一起比较只会带来负面的激励效果:条件好的地区不好好干也可以轻松胜出,而条件差的地区不管如何努力也无法赶超,其结果只能是条件好的地区不努力,条件差的地区也不努力,自暴自弃。因此,如何选择“可比地区”进行晋升竞争、使之产生合适激励,是政治锦标赛治理的重要内容。事实上,上级政府在设计晋升竞争的考核方式时也认识到选择合适的参照基准的意义,并在实践中加以运用。如前所述,中央在考核省级领导官员的绩效时不仅仅看他们本省的绝对经济绩效,而且还参考多个可比较的基准,比如地方官员的直接前任的平均GDP增长绩效,同期全国平均GDP增长率以及邻近地区的GDP增长率(周黎安等,2005;Landry et al.,2015)。

政治锦标赛的有效实施主要来自两方面的现实威胁:第一,政治锦标赛不能公平、公正和公开地推行,地方官员的晋升与考核的经济绩效无关,而是由其他一些人为因素决定,如“跑官买官”和“裙带主义”。这类似于足球比赛中的“黑哨”,比赛的胜负取决于一些赛场之外的因素,运动员的激励完全被扭曲了。黑龙江、辽宁等地爆出过大面积的“买官卖官”现象,导致这些地区经济长期不振,这正是锦标赛规则被扭曲变形的例子。第二,地方官员失去参与竞赛的兴趣和热情,看淡政治晋升,只求保住位子。这种情况的发生,通常是利益关系人给予官员的经济贿赂超过了政治晋升的“诱惑”,或者竞争过于激烈,晋升机会渺茫。从中央或上级政府的角度来看,政府官员与地方利益相关人结成联盟而“主动”放弃比赛,同时又收受贿赂、利益输送,这是推行政治锦标赛最大的一种威胁。[^11] 因此,如何满足地方官员的参与约束对于锦标赛设计来说至关重要。

当政治锦标赛运行到一定阶段,经济发展绩效成为官员晋升的关键要素的时候,体制内就会衍生出一些应对策略,以隐蔽的方式操纵比赛结果,影响锦标赛的公平性。其中最有影响的策略就是“输送政绩”,比如利用上下级领导或其他人脉关系从上层获得更多的项目和资源,加大本地区的增长速度;或者把所庇护的官员送到经济增长快的地区任职。最近曝光的周永康腐败案披露了这方面的相关信息。据《21世纪经济报道》9月3日报道,蒋洁敏与薄熙来多有交集,通过在薄熙来的任职地兴建石油炼化项目为其提升政绩。薄在辽宁省任省长时,蒋洁敏就推动中石油扩建或兴建石油炼化项目,薄后来去了重庆,蒋又如法炮制。薄在重庆任市委书记不久,中石油就表示在重庆市长寿区投资近150亿人民币,建设一个具备生产650万吨成品油能力的炼油厂。2009年又宣布将这一炼油厂的生产能力提升至1000万吨。[^12] 苏荣与蒋洁敏在仕途上曾经有过交集,2001年当苏荣担任青海省委书记时,蒋洁敏是青海省副省长,有三年共事的经历。蒋洁敏1999年至2000年5月担任中国石油天然气集团公司董事、副总裁,2000年6月从中石油调往青海,2004年4月又调回中国石油天然气集团公司任副总经理。因为这段交集,蒋洁敏很快就给2003年转任甘肃省委书记的苏荣送来了一份超级“大礼”。这就是2005年4月兰州石化大乙烯工程的破土动工。这个乙烯改扩建工程使得兰州石化形成千万吨炼油和70万吨乙烯规模,是中石油在西部地区最大的炼油化工产品生产基地,工程总投资近70亿元,也是甘肃省历史上最大的工程建设项目,对于苏荣来说,这显然属于他可以反复宣传的巨大“政绩”。[^13] 苏荣后转任江西省委书记,蒋洁敏的利益输送也就跟着到了缺少油气资源的江西。苏荣主政江西时提出了造林绿化“一大四小”的发展思路。与此相配合,中石油就确定投资8000万元在江西种植20万亩能源林。2009年7月24日,苏荣在南昌会见了“高升”为中国石油天然气集团公司总经理、党组书记的蒋洁敏。蒋洁敏承诺“中石油将不断加大在江西的投资,为江西的能源发展和经济社会发展作出积极贡献”。在双方会见前不久,中石油江西分公司刚刚上马了九江湖口油库工程,该项目是中石油全资兴建的先进储油库,是中石油在江西最大的油库,同时也被列入了江西省重点工程。配套工程的还有输油码头等工程。2011年3月8日,江西省人民政府与中国石油天然气集团公司在北京签署战略合作协议,苏荣、蒋洁敏出席签约仪式。根据战略合作协议,双方将在天然气、成品油、管网保护等方面开展广泛的合作。[^14]

任何一种强激励的竞争博弈一定会引发造假、犯规、暗箱操作等对抗竞争规则的应对策略,这在最公平的体育比赛中也屡见不鲜。政治锦标赛面临同样的威胁,GDP数据造假、帮派主义、输送政绩等行为就是其中的反映。“石油帮”以项目输送政绩的惯常做法经媒体披露之后而广为人知,但应该不是唯一的例子。只要政治锦标赛在中国政府治理中还要发挥作用,如何保证政治锦标赛的公平性和竞争性永远是一个艰巨的挑战。竞争规则与反竞争策略必然是共生共存,就像孪生兄弟一样,问题是如何将反竞争策略控制在一定的范围之内。

## 5.2 政治锦标赛的激励效应及其局限

当经济学家讨论市场失灵的时候也注意到政府失灵的情形(Buchanan and Tullock,1962)。从根本上说,政府失灵是政治家或职业官僚的激励未能与委托人(比如选民)的利益协调一致,在政治决策和行动领域出现了委托—代理问题。在任何社会,政治家或政府官员最终都是关心仕途的发展,差别只在于决定仕途的具体机制和制度环境不同而已。就这个意义而言,政府治理的核心是如何将政治家(政府官员)的政治仕途与反映社会需求的一定的标准相联系,最大限度地减少委托代理问题。一些经济学家在反思“华盛顿共识”的过程中提出了“制度共识”,强调“把制度搞对”(Rodrick,2004),“把激励搞对”(Easterly,2005)。这里我们进一步提出“把官员激励搞对”,这是政府治理的核心问题。

在第1章我们已经指出,政府治理的特征源于政府官员的自由裁量权和政府所从事的职责的特殊性质。政府官员手中拥有的自由裁量权因为权力垄断的性质而容易演变成“合法伤害权”。另一方面,政府职责具有多维度、多任务的特征且不易量化,使得基于量化指标的有效激励合约无法存在,加上公共服务的垄断性,这是为什么激励政府官员成为各国政府治理的难题。在中国,政府官员手中的权力更具特殊性:一是行政权力巨大,政府支配了重要的经济资源(如资金、土地和产业政策);二是政府权力所受约束有限,中国政府治理的层层发包体制更是赋予了地方官员许多的自由裁量权(如“一把手”现象),自由裁量权演变成“合法伤害权”的威胁经常存在,对地方经济发展构成了严重的障碍。事实上,政府的低效率和官员腐败是绝大多数发展中国家经济发展面临的最大障碍(Easterly,2005;Fukuyama,2011,2014)。

以经济发展绩效为基础的政治锦标赛最大的作用是在地方官员之间引入了竞争机制,这种政治竞争随着生产要素(尤其是物质资本和人力资本)的流动性日益增大而加剧。地方官员之间激烈的晋升竞争推动了地区间的经济竞争,各级地方政府不得不主动追逐关键性生产要素(如人才、资本和技术),以便获得产业发展的先机。经常被人们诟病的政府部门效率低下、官僚主义作风其实就是政府的垄断性以及政府绩效难以量化考核造成的,中国通过引入地方主要官员的晋升竞争,并将晋升与地区经济增长挂钩彻底改变了这种情况。为了吸引外部投资,地方主政官带领政府相关部门,优化管理流程,改进服务效率,完善基础设施和商业环境。政治竞争激发了地方官员的服务意识和创新行为,大幅削减了政府部门的垄断租金,政府由通常的发展瓶颈转变为发展的推动力,由潜在的“掠夺之手”变为“帮助之手”,这是政治锦标赛的魔力所在。

在第1章,我们将中国的市场化改革与非国有部门的发展比喻为“与虎谋皮”的过程,政策、管制与经济资源均掌握在各级地方政府手里,而市场化改革与非国有部门的发展都需要各地的“老虎”让渡“皮肉”,以此说明中国的改革与发展之难。显然如果全国只有一只老虎,那么一切都不会发生;然而,正是官员晋升锦标赛让各地的“老虎”相互竞争,老虎的福利与地区的蛋糕大小紧密挂钩,看似不可能的“与虎谋皮”变成了现实,而且出现“老虎”竞相让渡“皮肉”的现象。

中国在司法意义上的产权保护制度尚存在许多缺陷,尤其是民营企业容易受到各种歧视,合法权益有时不被尊重;国际投资者也经常怀疑中国能否提供良好、稳定的商业和政策环境,保护投资的安全性。这是人们按照西方国家的标准检查中国正式制度安排最可能产生的疑问。然而,过去三十年中国地方政府的招商引资政策获得了巨大的成功,使得中国外资流入量长期以来位于世界前列。[^15] 国内民营投资也一直增长迅猛,受到各地政府官员的关注和追捧。外资和民企投资对于产权保护和政商环境是极为敏感的,尤其对于处于弱势地位的国内民营企业更是如此。这两类非国有投资的高速增长说明中国大部分地区的地方政府为非国有企业提供了重要的投资保护。[^16] 当然,这些投资保护主要不是通过更为彻底的法治化而是通过地方官员的行政保护实现的。地方官员愿意提供投资保护显然是因为锦标赛竞争,如果企业家感到投资环境差,没有安全感,他就转向别的地方,或者被竞争对手抢走。因此,从根本上说,政治锦标赛是非国有企业产权得到保护、政策环境得以优化的制度基础,它是对正式的产权保护和司法制度的一种重要替代。在理想情况下,基于司法制度的产权保护显然比基于官员晋升激励的保护更持久、更有效,然而,当司法制度尚不发达、难以提供有效的产权保护的时候,基于官员激励的行政保护就是一种次优的选择。

在中国的行政体制下,地方官员的道德风险问题(如腐败、不作为或乱作为)主要靠上级政府对其进行监督和制约,而来自政府之外的监督(如媒体和老百姓)非常有限,但上级政府因为信息不对称,在很多情况下监督的效果并不如意。更严重的挑战是,在一个多层级的等级组织中,委托人需要委派监督者去监督代理人的行为,如中央政府需要依赖省级政府监督基层政府,省级政府依赖地级市监督县级政府,可是,监督者与被监督者存在合谋的可能性。谁来监督监督者?这是任何一个等级组织面临的核心问题。只有处于最高层的委托人有充分的激励监督下级,而对于委托人之下的多层级监督者,因为信息不对称,其监督激励则依次递减。对于中国这样一个具有五个层级的政府体系来说,谁来监督监督者的问题就显得尤为突出。

有趣的是,中国自改革开放以来推行的以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛,在每个地方政府的层级上同时发生。实际上让每一级地方政府都处在和它相匹配的对手进行地区竞争的格局,省与省比,市与市比,县与县比,镇与镇比,每个层级的地方官员的仕途升迁都与本地经济发展绩效挂钩。在这样一个多层级互动的政治锦标赛中,我们不仅没有看到监督成本递增带来的官员激励递减,反而是地方官员的激励随层级下降而递增。一个重要的例证来自我和合作者关于“层层加码”现象的研究(Li et al.,2012;周黎安等,2015)。我们发现,从五年规划到年度经济计划的GDP增长指标,呈现随政府层级从上到下而不断加码的现象。[^17] 这说明多层级的政治锦标赛以一种奇特的方式解决了等级组织内部信息不对称和监督激励依次递减的问题,大大节约了政府体系的监督成本。

政治锦标赛与中国行政体制的某些特征相结合有助于克服发展中国家经常面临的国家治理的挑战,即所谓的“政治公有地悲剧”:每一个政府部门都想对企业进行“搜刮”,而没考虑到其搜刮对别的政府部门的负外部性(即一个部门搜刮多了企业可供其他部门搜刮的就少了),最终导致政府对企业的过度“搜刮”(Shelifer and Vishny,1993)。在中国,地方政府的行政权力主要集中于各级党委,尤其是党委一把手,这导致了行政权力的过度集中;但另一方面,当权力集中到少数领导手中,他们所面临的增长激励就可以转化为对下属政府部门的强有力约束,这比权力高度分散在各个政府部门、各自为政要容易避免政治公有地悲剧的产生。[^18] Frye和Shleifer(1997)认为,中国地方政府扮演“帮助之手”,而俄罗斯地方政府扮演“掠夺之手”,其重要原因就在于中国政府的权力比后者更为集中,更好地克服了公有地悲剧。当然,权力集中本身仍然不能保证“帮助之手”,政治锦标赛才是“帮助之手”的最重要的制度来源。

从政治经济学的角度看,政府官员可能受到某些利益集团的影响,导致出台的公共政策偏向特殊利益集团,牺牲公众利益,这就是政府被利益集团“捕获”的问题(Stigler,1971)。在中国经济转型和发展过程中,地方政府也难以摆脱各种潜在利益集团的影响。比如在改革过程中,国有部门的利益诉求会阻碍地方民营化和吸引外资的进程,民营企业可能会买通地方监管部门。在民主政体下,政治家和国会议员经常接受利益集团的政治献金,企业、工会等利益集团竞相向政治家和立法部门施加影响,出台一些不利于经济增长的立法或监管政策。这种情况在许多国家都非常普遍。

在中国,地方政府也难免会受到一些利益集团的影响,但是,在政治锦标赛体制下,这些利益集团或多或少应该对当地经济增长是有利的,至少不会形成长期的破坏。这是因为,如果地方官员的根本利益在于政治晋升,那么一切利益诉求必须与经济增长的要求相兼容,至少不能相抵触,否则地方官员自身的政治利益会受到伤害。必须指出的是,在地方官员与地方利益集团极可能形成各种利益联盟的情况下,政治锦标赛是一种限制政府官员被狭隘的利益集团捕获而导致地区增长迟滞的治理手段。当然,中国的情况可能是走向了另一个极端,政企联盟使得民众迫切关心的许多问题(如环境污染、教育、医疗等民生问题)也被忽略了。

从经济学的角度看,锦标赛与激励合约代表两种不同的激励机制(Lazear and Rosen,1981;Malcomson,1984;Lazear,1995)。在中国的体制背景下,1980—1992年中央与省签订的财政包干合约就是经济学定义的激励合约[^19] ,如果省区财政收入超过某个规定水平(比例),就可以获得剩余部分(或剩余比例),钱颖一等经济学家强调的中国特色的财政联邦主义就是基于这些财政方面的激励合约(Qian and Weingast,1997)。那么,从激励效应来说,政治锦标赛与财政包干合约有何重要区别?

与财政包干制相比,政治锦标赛的一个突出优点是奖励承诺比较可信。这种可信度来自两个方面:一是指标比较透明,各参与人都能观察到各自的业绩和委托人是否按照事前宣布的规则兑现承诺。设想上级领导完全根据主观感觉(也许他心里有一个确定的主观指标)提拔下属,下属并不知道领导究竟看重什么,也不知道是否每次都公正客观地实施了他自己的标准,可信承诺自然无从说起。二是提拔竞赛优胜者并不花费委托人的额外资源(Malcomson,1984),因为职位在事前是固定的,如果有空缺的话,无论如何需要提拔一人填补它,因此在决出优胜者之后委托人没有改变事前承诺的激励。从这个意义上说,委托人做出的提拔优胜者的承诺比用巨额奖金奖励优胜者(如财政包干合约)的承诺要可信得多,因为后者取决于委托人的财政状况,而且事后容易滋生不兑现承诺的动机。中央与地方的财政包干制在具体执行过程中就出现过承诺不可信的情况(Ma,1997;Wong et al.,1995)。中央政府因财政困难经常改变过去的合约承诺,或者通过向省政府“借钱”的方式人为改变省政府可以实际获得的财政收入分成。行政分权作为一种激励机制也是类似的,中央给地方的分权可以随时调整。近年来中央与地方、省与地方的行政权限一直处在变动之中,所以分权承诺的可信度是相当有限的。

值得强调的是,政治锦标赛还会再生产出一种维持这种激励制度的积极因素,从而较好地解决关于改革开放承诺的可信度问题。按照目前的晋升制度,经济竞赛的优胜者更可能获得晋升,提拔到更高一级的领导岗位,成为决定下级政府官员晋升命运的评判者。由于他们是这种激励制度的成功者,维护其正常运行自然符合他们自身的偏好和既得利益。中国特色的联邦主义理论无法令人满意地解释中央对分权和市场化改革的可信承诺。按照政治锦标赛理论,这一点并不难解释:随着越来越多的来自经济发展迅速和市场化程度高的省级领导人晋升到中央决策部门,在当前党的集体领导的决策体制下,他们的偏好和利益决定了中国改革开放基本政策的稳定性和承诺的可信度。

上面我们强调的政治锦标赛的激励作用,即在晋升竞争过程中地方官员的个人利益与当地经济发展紧密联系在一起,主要基于相对绩效评估和地方官员之间的竞争这些角度。除此之外,我们还想特别强调,中国地方官员的政治锦标赛是一种逐级淘汰的多层级的晋升竞争结构,这有两个可以引申的重要含义。首先,逐级淘汰的多层级晋升竞争结构使得省区领导人的晋升激励可以逐级传递给最基层的地方官员,如前所述,这种激励传导是逐渐放大的。其次,逐级淘汰的多层级晋升竞争还带来了一个新的激励来源,那就是职业前景激励(career concerns)。[^20]

多层级的职位晋升结构意味着从基层开始的地方官员必须在官场长久地工作和表现,而地方官员在任何一个职位上的表现都会被上级政府的组织部门所关注,成为组织人事部门评估其潜在能力的基础。因此,地方官员在一个职位上表现好,不仅帮助他(她)赢得同级晋升竞争的优胜,而且还为未来的晋升创造更大的机会,因为人事组织部门会把好的绩效解释为这个官员杰出的领导才能,从而可能会在未来的提拔考核中特别注意(Yao and Zhang,2015)。

政治锦标赛是一种强激励(high-powered incentives)的形式,政府官员的晋升高度依赖于一些可测度的经济指标。但政府的职责如前所述是多维度和多任务的,有些容易测度,有些不容易测度,政治锦标赛等于聚焦于可测度的、与经济绩效相关的“硬指标”,而将那些不容易测度的指标放在“软指标”系列里。根据Holmstrom和Migrom(1991)多任务下的委托—代理理论,如果激励的设计只是基于一些可测度的指标,很容易导致代理人的努力配置扭曲,将精力集中在可测度的任务,而忽略不可测度但同样重要的任务。事实上,中国经济增长面临的许多问题正是这种配置扭曲的结果(第10章将详细讨论)。所以在这种情况下,弱激励形式是一种常见的组织设计,将代理人的报酬与绩效基本脱钩,以谋求代理人对多任务低水平(因激励不足)但较为平衡的努力配置。这就产生了一个重要而有趣的问题:多任务下强激励在企业组织内也不常见,那为什么在中国的政府治理中会采用?

中国政府体制的特征是权力的一体化和等级化,地方政府主要面临上级政府的垂直监督,所受的水平方向的监督和制约非常有限,尤其是政府公共服务的直接对象——民众与企业不能直接影响地方官员的任命,虽然他们是最有信息监督和评价政府服务质量的主体。而中国长期以来的属地化分级行政管理体制又强化了地方政府的实际权力,尤其是自由处置权。给定政府目标的多维性和多任务特征,如果上级政府采用弱激励方式,让官员的晋升与当地经济增长或其他可测度的经济指标脱钩,采取一种模糊和主观的评价方式决定官员的政绩,那势必导致地方官员的自由处置权最终变成了官员偷懒、受贿或不作为的特权。这里最大的困难在于,如果人事任免权和对官员的考察权均在上级政府,上级政府不易获得有关下级地方官员的能力和服务质量的信息,这种信息成本越高,地方官员手里的自由处置权(合法伤害权)也就越多。因此,在这种背景下,采用以经济绩效为基础的政治锦标赛作为一种强激励形式是对地方官员手中不受监督和制约的自由处置权的一种强力引导。虽然带来努力扭曲、政绩工程等等问题,但至少换来了相当水平的经济增长,这比弱激励下政府的不作为、懒政、腐败要好。这可以看做是“两害相权取其轻”的结果。

当然,在地方官员考核的实际运作中,对于一些重要的非经济绩效的指标(组织部门称之为“约束性指标”),如社会维稳、计划生育、环境保护、安全生产,通常采取末位淘汰制、一票否决制或问责制。比如计划生育出现了“一票否决”情况,单位的主要负责人、分管领导将失去评选先进荣誉、晋职晋级的资格。这种以淘汰落后者为目标的考核方式被学者称为“政治淘汰赛”(李国强,2012;聂军,2015)。政治淘汰赛对于委托人来说是一种“底线控制”,旨在防止最坏的情况出现,对于代理人来说则是必须付出最低的努力水平。

对于那些与经济发展相关的“硬指标”采取奖励先进的锦标赛竞争,对于那些重要的社会综合治理指标,则列为“约束性指标”,采取淘汰赛方式一票否决,以此塑造多目标、多任务条件下的双重激励机制。应该说,这是改革开放以来中国形成的极具特色的地方官员激励制度,是中国在其独特的政经条件下解决政府激励难题的独特方式。

但是,政治锦标赛和政治淘汰赛均以可观测、可量化的指标为依据,这些指标属于委托人认为最为重要的一些发展和治理指标,对于一些难以量化和观测的绩效,如基础教育、医疗、社会保障、社会公平,介于绩效考核的“硬指标”和“约束性指标”之间,属于“软指标”,目前仍然没有找到合适的考核方式,因而容易出现配置扭曲和供给不足的情况。除非公众对政府服务的评价意见能以某种方式进入官员绩效的考核之中,使得上级政府面临的信息约束放松,从而减少对政治锦标赛的依赖,否则“两害相权取其轻”的取舍就不可避免。进一步说,在中国目前的政府体制下,政治锦标赛的推行与上级政府面临的信息和监督约束,或者说地方官员面临的监督方式直接相关,主要以垂直监督为主,还是以水平监督(如媒体和公众)为主,对政府治理模式的选择影响巨大。

在一个多层级的政府结构中,单纯依靠晋升激励去调动官员努力工作的积极性会遇上一个非常棘手的问题:对于晋升机会渺茫的人来说,锦标赛体制将失去正向的激励效应。放在中国具体的制度环境下,这个问题表现为两个方面:首先,处于中国整个权力金字塔底部的基层官员晋升机会稍纵即逝,许多人年纪轻轻就已经看不到晋升希望了;其次,对于那些经过多年奋斗、已经处于权力高位的官员来说,因为年龄和晋升机会的原因,晋升激励面临衰竭的危险。

为了深入理解中国政府体制底部晋升之难,让我们聚焦县乡基层干部的仕途阶梯和晋升前景(洪晓静等,2010)。县市一级公务员众多,但领导职务相对较少。仅就科级职务来说,基本上是1∶10左右的比例,即一个科级领导对应着10个公务员。越往上晋升机会越少,晋升空间极为有限。一个普通公务员要想晋升到科级职务,如果一切顺利,一般需要10—15年;而在省市层级上,由于领导职位相对较多,起点高,台阶少,一个公务员按部就班工作5年左右就可以晋升到科级甚至更高的职级。

一个普通县的县级领导一般为50人,每年约有3—4人退出县级领导岗位。一个县正科实职党政一把手约300人,如空缺的县级岗位全部从本县正科实职中选拔,每个正科实职升副县级的概率为1%左右。由于年龄方面的限制,乡镇党委书记继续升迁的时间窗口也就几年,加上升任副县级往往需要有在不同乡镇任党委书记的经历。因此,对于大多数党委书记而言,这个职位已经到顶了。

从副县级干部到县委副书记,一般需要经历9个岗位,8个台阶:副县级干部—政协副主席—人大副主任—政府副县长—县委常委(兼统战部长)—政法委书记—政府常委副县长—政府常务副县长—县委专职副书记。假设某人任副县级干部时仅仅30岁,每个岗位仅干3年即往上晋升,干满9个岗位时已经是57岁。根据很多地方的规定,副县级干部55岁即须退出领导岗位。从副县级干部至县委副书记,看似不断在进步,但从级别来说其实还是原地踏步,这反映了县乡级别低,台阶多,年龄要求高,晋升之难可想而知。中央、省、市机关提拔一级是进一大步,县乡干部提拔一级则可能仍在原地踏步。

基层公务员晋升之难意味着在整个政府体系中只有少数人受着仕途前景激励,大多数人不受此影响,那么少数“积极分子”如何带动大多数的“散漫之人”呢?对于企业和老百姓来说,接触政府最多的人就是这些不受晋升激励影响的“多数人”,他们是为社会提供公共服务的主体。社会普遍抱怨政府“脸难看,门难进,事难办”,这是不是折射出其中激励难的问题呢?后面第9章第5节我们将讨论一个地区同一个政府体制之中“帮助之手”与“掠夺之手”的区分,就与晋升激励的结构性差异密切相关。

当一个地方官员从最基层一步步晋升到较高层的位置,越来越接近仕途的顶峰时,其晋升激励却可能逐渐衰减。[^21] 一方面年龄逐渐增大,仕途越来越短,而另一方面,官场竞争却越来越激烈,因为竞争对手越来越强,都是前面多次晋升竞争的优胜者。在这种情况下,官员参加下一轮竞争的动机可能会相应减弱,产生“因循守成”的念头。作为行政事务的总承包方和第一行政责任人的地方高级官员,如果对于中央或上级政府手中挥舞的晋升指挥棒都无动于衷了,那会出现什么可怕的局面呢?所以,面对地方官员晋升激励逐步衰减的现实,上级政府在设计政治锦标赛的激励结构时,必须考虑到如何相应加大对高层官员的激励,否则国家的行政治理会陷入困境和危机。[^22] 高级地方官员不断加大的行政责任和日益衰减的晋升激励之间的内在冲突构成中国传统行政治理机制设计中的巨大隐患和挑战。

锦标赛体制面临权力金字塔底部的晋升之难和上层官员激励衰竭的双重挑战,应该如何应对呢?在一个金字塔的科层结构中,要增加向上流动性,主要有两个基本的应对策略,一是尽可能拓展晋升空间,增加晋升概率;二是在每个层级上采取换人策略,每隔一段时间就用年龄划线,强行换人,将晋升激励衰竭的官员换成晋升激励高的年轻人,让年轻人晋升到重要的领导岗位。[^23]

在一个权力金字塔的结构中,官职的位置(职位)由政府等级和岗位决定,数量相对固定,增加的空间不大。然而,在现实中政府部门仍然千方百计开拓职位的晋升空间。最常见的是增加一些非正式的领导职位数量(正式的领导职位数量一般是固定的),在晋升序列里增加一些“夹层”,如市长助理、县长助理、副秘书长等等。媒体曾经报道某些市县有十到二十几个县长助理,某些高校有十几个校长助理。或者通过增设一些办事机构增加领导职位,安排干部到事业单位任职,解决晋升空间狭窄的问题。中国曾经历9次行政机构改革,每次改革的阻力都在于人员的安置问题,其中领导职位的减少直接威胁到现有干部的职位流动性。

在现有的金字塔结构下要增加官员的晋升空间,还有一个办法就是增加职级晋升空间。在领导职务数量固定的情况下提高公务员的职级待遇(即所谓的“高配”,如县委书记享受副厅级待遇),让每个人在职务晋升无望之时仍然有一个对应的职级晋升序列,职级与工资福利待遇挂钩,职务与职级分离的改革就是旨在拓宽基层公务员的晋升和发展空间。然而,职级晋升序列的增加需要增加财政投入,如果主要是增加基层公务员的职级序列,财政投入的数额还可能是巨大的。

所以,长期以来,中国应对晋升体制难题的策略是采取“换人”战术,让一些人腾出职务和职级留给后面的年轻人,这就是干部管理制度的“年轻化”政策,包括一刀切“按年龄划线”“培养年轻人”“退居二线”等人事政策。到这里我们就可以深刻理解,为什么从80年代初期开始,中央就一直强调选拔领导干部的“四化”标准,其中执行最彻底、要求最严格的就是领导干部的年轻化。

我们先看看基层政府人事制度的“年轻化”路线。按照一些地方县市换届选举规定,乡镇班子中必须配备一名30岁以下,县(市)区班子中必须配备一名35岁左右的常委成员。可以看出,30岁和35岁是县(市)领导干部的关键年龄点。超过35岁还没有达到副处级,在县(市)就不再具备年龄优势。45岁一般认为是上升的最后期限,超过这个年龄点,最可能的结果就是平稳过渡到退居二线。有的地方规定,过了45岁,原则上不能再担任区县党政一把手。地级市一级的领导53岁之后就失去了提拔的机会。[^24]

许多地方在干部任用上长期以年龄划线,过度追求年轻化。比如在配备领导班子时遵循如下隐含原则:35岁以上的不再提拔进入乡镇党政领导班子,40岁以上的基本不再提拔进入县级领导班子。衡阳市在2011年市县(市)区党委换届时规定,年满50周岁不进区县常委班子,年满52周岁就必须从区县常委班子退出,转到人大政协或其他岗位任职。而35岁之前要升任副科级等待组织提拔对于绝大多数人来说其实是小概率事件。设想一个大学生毕业22岁进入乡镇工作,一般需要5年成为“股级”干部,再2年转为副科级,再3年变为正科级,再3年成为副处级,这个流程最快也需要12—13年的时间。

对于省部级官员,尽可能提拔一些年轻人进入领导岗位也是常见的做法。中央不仅每隔一段时间就会突出年轻化和培养后备干部的必要性,而且经常下达领导班子的年龄搭配比例,要求40多岁的年轻干部必须达到多少比例。[^25] 当然,形成高层岗位的老中青三代领导干部的年龄搭配也是有助于传帮带实现领导权力的平稳交接班,但是不可否认的是,高层领导干部的年轻化可以有效减缓晋升激励的衰减效应,这是人事制度方面一举两得的有力措施。

年轻化和一刀切式的“年龄划线”不是免费的午餐,这些做法直接带来了几个严重后果。首先,对于过了年龄杠杆的干部来说,不管才能如何突出,精力如何充沛,升官无望,仕途终结,激励很可能出现断崖式下降。而这些干部到达仕途关键节点,已经积累了丰富的人生阅历和工作经验,业务精通,本可以大展宏图,现在却英雄无用武之地,显然是人力资本的极大浪费。而且升官无望可能引发干部“乘机捞一把”的贪腐动机。其次,对于那些尚在仕途上奔跑的人来说,年龄杠杆犹如紧箍咒一般,一旦错失一个机会,就会感到处处失去机会,最终放弃努力,转而寻思抄近路、走捷径,跑官买官,或者大肆敛财,兑现权力租金。“35岁现象”其实就是年龄划线的一个产物。

一刀切式的年龄划线带来如此严重的资源错配,中央三令五申,要求组织部门不要按年龄一刀切。50岁退居二线也明显缺乏法律依据,因此一直“秘而不宣”,以潜规则形式运行。但是各地还是如此顽强地推行这些看似疯狂的“年轻化”政策。这背后反映了一个多层级的政治锦标赛有效运转的内在张力,即晋升流动性与公平性的内在矛盾。为了使政治锦标赛产生足够的激励效应,让公务员持续感受到仕途希望,官场必须在每一个权力阶梯上保持一定的向上流动性。而做到这一点就必须牺牲公平性,强制让一些人提前成为仕途竞争的牺牲品。

## 5.3 从毛泽东时代到邓小平时代

政治锦标赛是中国政府治理的一个核心激励机制,所以在任何时候,如何选择进入晋升竞争的参与人和确定政治晋升的标准,都是中国干部人事制度设计的重中之重。从干部的选拔和提升标准就可以看出这一时期国家工作的重点放在哪里。中国共产党的领导人一直强调组织路线对于贯彻执行党的政治路线和思想路线的关键性意义。本节我们想对中国干部人事制度的历史演变做一个简要的描述,尤其侧重在改革开放之后所经历的重要变化,由此我们可以看到政治锦标赛从毛泽东时代到邓小平时代的重要转型。

新中国建立之后,随着各级政权的建立和政府机构的增多,中国逐步建立了一整套干部人事管理制度。首先是确立“党管干部”的原则,党在干部的任免方面具有决定性的权力,干部的提名、考核、任免等管理权集中到党的组织部门;其次是“分部分级”管理,“分部管理”就是按工作需要把全体干部分为九类(如军队、文教、政法、计划与工业、财贸、交通运输、农林水利等),在中央及各级党委组织部的统一管理下,由中央及各级党委的各部分别进行具体管理;“分级管理”就是指在中央和地方各级党委之间,建立分工管理各级干部的制度;在改革之前中国推行的是“下管两级”的政策,即中央负责省和地级市一级干部的任命,省级政府负责县乡两级干部的任命。在干部选拔标准方面,一般强调“德才兼备”和“又红又专”,一方面要专业化和知识化,另一方面要有优良的政治品质,要忠于党的路线方针;在具体实施过程中,政治品质占据更为重要的位置。由于从50年代初期开始就不断有各种各样的政治运动,对于地方领导来说,如何在历次政治运动中做到表现出色就是非常关键的挑战。“大跃进”时期,我们看到各级地方政府竞相“粮食放卫星”和“大炼钢铁”,这可以看做是围绕着粮食产量和钢铁产量而展开的政治锦标赛(周飞舟,2009;Kung and Chen,2011;Fan et al.,2014)。进入“文革”时期之后,中国的干部人事制度被严重破坏,领导干部的提拔和任用缺乏统一明确的标准,既无任职资格审定也无任职年限的规定,实际执行过程中以“造反精神”“忠于毛主席”的政治标准作为主流政策,一大批在“文化大革命”中靠造反起家的人被突击提拔到各级领导岗位。

粉碎“四人帮”之后,中共中央提出要把党的工作重心从阶级斗争转向经济建设,实现四个现代化。中国自此进入了划时代的经济、政治和社会转型。邓小平很早就指出,中国的稳定,四个现代化的实现,要有正确的组织路线来保证。而解决组织路线问题,最大的问题,也是最艰难、最迫切的问题,是选好接班人。[^26]

为此,党的组织工作的重心就必须完全转到为社会主义现代化建设事业服务的轨道上来。1979年9—10月中央组织部召开了全国组织工作座谈会,着重讨论了接班人的问题、领导班子建设问题、干部制度改革问题、落实干部政策等问题,提出无论是考核、选拔干部,还是调整领导班子、培训提高干部,都必须以促进和确保四个现代化的实现为目的,并力求取得最好的效果。1981年,党的十一届六中全会通过了《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》,明确提出要废除干部领导职务实际上存在的终身制,改变权力过分集中的状况,要求在坚持革命化的前提下逐步实现各级领导人员的年轻化、知识化和专业化。这就是著名的干部队伍建设的“四化”方针。

从新中国成立到80年代初,党和国家对领导干部任职的年龄和期限没有明文规定。一个干部只要不犯大的错误,可以不受年龄、健康、任期的限制而无限制做下去,形成了事实上的领导职务的终身制,导致各级领导干部随着时间的推移而呈现老龄化的现象。尤其是粉碎“四人帮”之后,大批老干部恢复工作,重新回到领导岗位,使得干部队伍的平均年龄严重偏大,知识水平偏低。据统计,1965年,国家机关三十多个单位的主要领导人的平均年龄是55岁,其中55岁以下的占70%,66岁以下的只占5.7%。而到了1980年,平均年龄变成了63岁,其中55岁以下的仅占9%,66岁以上的占了40%以上。这是一个高度老龄化的干部队伍。在全国2000多万干部中,大学毕业的只占20%左右,初中文化以下的在40%以上(陈凤楼,2003,第223页)。到1982年,在大革命时期、土地革命时期、抗日战争时期和解放战争时期参加革命的老干部还有250万人健在,其中绝大部分还在工作岗位上(同上,第231页)。在各级领导班子中,非常缺乏那些既懂专业又懂管理的领导干部。

于是中央就面临一个如何让老干部退下去、新干部提上来的艰巨任务。为了彻底解决领导干部的职务终身制的问题,党的十一届六中全会通过了《关于建国以来若干历史问题的决议》,正式提出要废除干部领导职务的终身制。十二大通过的党章进一步明确规定,党的各级领导干部的职务都不是终身的,都可以变动或解除。年龄和健康状况不适宜于继续担任工作的干部,应该按照国家的规定,办理离职休养或者退休。1982年中共中央颁布了《关于建立老干部退休制度的决定》,规定担任中央或地方省部级领导干部,正职一般不超过65岁,副职一般不超过60岁。担任司局长一级的干部,一般不超过60岁。个别未到离退休年龄,但因身体不好,经批准可提前离退休。领导干部退居二线,包括当顾问和荣誉职务,不属于离休退休。到1986年底,全国共有137万建国前参加工作的老干部离休或退休(同上,第233页)。通过建立老干部的离退休和退居二线制度,中央以一种渐进的方式解决了组织路线的调整问题。

一方面是妥善安排老干部的离退休和退居二线,另一方面就是加快对新人的提拔。领导干部的“四化”首先从中央最高领导机构开始。在十二大上,一大批德高望重的老同志退出第一线,一大批相对年轻、精力充沛的干部进入了中央委员会。在十二大选出的348名中央委员和候补委员的名单中,新选入的委员和候补委员有211人,占60.6%,其中三分之二的年龄在60岁以下,具有大专以上学历的有120人,专业人员增加到159人。十二大之后,全国各级领导班子按照“四化”的标准进行了调整。中央和国家机关率先进行,国务院所属41个部委的正副部长、主任平均年龄由原来的65.7岁下降54岁,具有大专文化程度的人数由原来的35.5%提高到52%。1982年10月省级领导班子开始进行调整。中央规定,党委常委和政府领导班子中要有熟悉工业、农业、文化、教育、科技、财贸等各方面的人才;大专以上文化程度的要占三分之一。经过这次调整,省级领导班子的平均年龄由原来的62.3岁下降到55.5岁,其中55岁以下的由原来的15%提高到48%,40岁以下的有9人。具有大专以上文化程度的由原来的20%提高到43%,其中新进班子的人员中,大专以上文化程度的占71%。地、市、州党政领导班子的调整从1983年2月份开始,调整之后,党政领导班子的平均年龄由原来的58岁下降到50岁,具有大专以上文化程度的由14%提高到44%。全国有一万多名老同志退出了地、厅级领导班子。1983年底,县级党政领导班子开始调整,中央要求县级领导班子的平均年龄控制在45岁左右。调整之后,除了北京和上海平均年龄略高过45岁之外,其他省市自治区的平均年龄都在45岁以下。在县委常委和正副县长中,具有大学以上文化程度的人数由原来的10.8%提高到45%。县级领导干部调整使得全国有2万多名50多岁的干部退出了领导岗位。从1982年初到1984年夏,全国一共提拔了200多万中青年干部,到1985年底,一共有46万中青年干部走上县以上的领导岗位。

1986年,邓小平又提出党的十三大领导层年轻化的目标还要前进一步,希望中国能够出现一大批三四十岁的政治家、经济管理家、军事家、外交家。十三大人事安排贯彻了一个重要原则,即十二届中央委员和候补委员中,年龄在66岁以上(含66岁)者,一般不再提名。结果有150名十二届中央委员和候补中央委员没有进入十三届中央委员会,使得十三大选举产生的中央委员和候补中央委员的平均年龄(55.2岁)比上一届选举产生的中央委员和候补中央委员降低了近4岁,有大专学历的人数增加了近18%。

值得特别强调的是,领导干部的年轻化,加强对青年干部的培养,建立领导干部的后备力量和梯队,不只是在80年代初期为了实现新老交替而一次性推行的政策,它实际上是中央一再坚持的干部管理的基本战略,以便保持新老干部的及时和持续的交替轮换。例如,1992年中央就提出1993年省级党政领导班子成员的平均年龄要保持55岁左右,并明确规定,50岁以下的干部,在省级党委领导班子中,一般要有三人,政府领导班子要有两人,其中45岁左右的,党委和政府领导班子至少各有一人。地、县级领导班子成员的年龄构成应该更年轻一些。据统计,到1993年底,四川省地县(市)党政领导班子以40岁左右的干部为主体,地(市)党政领导班子以45岁左右的年轻干部为主体(陈凤楼,第277页)。到了1995年,中央又提出,在中央、国家机关和地方县级以上党政领导班子,要形成由不同年龄层次的干部组成的梯次结构,其中年轻干部所占的比例要有较大的提高。地方各级党政领导班子中有关年轻干部的比例也做了明确的规定。2000年中央组织部再次提出要加大力度,把大批的优秀年轻干部选拔进各级领导班子。要选拔一批40多岁的优秀领导干部补充到省级领导班子,选拔一批50岁左右的优秀年轻干部放到省部级主要领导岗位上锻炼、考验,选配一批40岁左右的领导干部进入地(市)、厅(局)党委正职岗位,选配一批35岁左右的干部进入县(处)党政正职岗位。

80年代初开始的干部人事制度改革除了建立离退休制度、实行干部选拔的“四化”,还有一个非常重要的变化,就是强调干部任职必须能上能下,对于不称职的干部可以进行降职和撤换。废除职务终身制,同时强调上级领导对下级干部的行政问责和绩效考核,是粉碎“四人帮”之后中国干部人事制度改革的一个重要环节。在80年代之前,领导干部只要不犯大的错误,不管健康、年龄和绩效如何,都可以长期担任领导职务,不存在严格的干部考核制度。粉碎“四人帮”以后,邓小平在一次讲话中指出:“要实行考核制度。考核必须是严格的、全面的,而且是经常的。各行各业都要这么做。”(邓小平,1994,第102页)1978年12月13日,在中央工作会议上邓小平又提出:“因为是非功过不清,赏罚不明,干和不干一个样,甚至干得好的反而受打击,什么事不干的,四平八稳的,都成为了‘不倒翁’。在这种不成文法底下,人们就不愿意去动脑筋了。”(同上,第142页)

1979年11月,中央组织部下发了《关于实行干部考核制度的意见》,要求建立和逐步完善对干部的考核制度,各地区、各部门要按照德才兼备的原则,根据各行各业的不同职务的干部胜任现职所应具备的条件,制定明确具体的考核标准和考核内容。1983年,全国组织工作座谈会提出要对党政领导干部实行年度考核,规定了德、能、勤、绩四个方面,着重考核干部的工作实绩。1986年经中央批准,中央组织部发出了《关于调整不胜任现职领导干部职务的几个问题的通知》,强调要以改革的精神妥善调整不胜任现职的领导干部,坚决实行干部职务能上能下,能下能上,逐步从制度上保证德才兼备、具有开创精神的干部能够脱颖而出,激励广大干部为实现新时期的宏伟目标而奋发向上、勇于竞争的精神,使整个干部队伍始终保持朝气和活力。从1988年开始全国试行对地方党政领导干部的年度工作考核制度,考核的对象包括全国地(市、州)、县(市、区)党委和政府领导干部和省(市、区)、地(市、州)、县(市、区)党委和政府的各工作部门的领导干部。对县(市、区)党政领导干部实行由上级领导机关负责,同级党委的全体委员和同级人民代表大会常务委员参与的考核制。对地方政府工作部门领导干部的年度考核,则实行首长负责的考核制。对于干部的绩效考核的制度逐步完善,成为中央控制和保证领导干部为促进经济发展和社会稳定的重要手段。在实际的绩效考核的过程中,有一个比较突出的倾向就是有些地方考核工作绩效偏重经济指标,而忽略了领导干部的其他方面,如思想表现。

在如此短的时间里,全国上下完成了如此大规模的干部新老交替,不能不说是一个奇迹。这一方面说明了以邓小平为核心的党的领导集体超凡的政治智慧和驾驭能力,抓住组织路线这个关键点,为中国的改革开放和经济发展奠定了坚实的人事制度基础。另一方面也反映了我国独特的行政体制所蕴涵的巨大能量以及灵活性。中国的政治经济从“大跃进”到十年“文革”,饱受动荡和折腾之苦,但一旦党的工作重心发生转移,就可以迅速完成党政领导干部的新老交替,确保整个国家沿着党设定的战略方向稳步前进。如果组织路线未能按照“四化”的标准进行调整,或者说这个过程进展缓慢,80年代进行的一系列重大的改革也许就会被阻挠、拖延,甚至搁置,就不会有后来改革开放的大好局面。推行地方和部门领导干部的年度考核制度则进一步激励了政府官员努力工作,锐意进取。在任何改革中,凡涉及大量人员裁减和调整的改革都是阻力最大的。“文化大革命”使得很多老干部被迫“靠边站”,甚至遭受迫害,终于盼来了“四人帮”下台,可以恢复工作,重新施展才能。可是,好景不长,“四化”方针又要求他们必须离开领导岗位,这个思想工作的难度是可以想象的。中央通过建立离退休制度和退居二线的制度,渐进平稳地实现了大批老干部退下去的艰巨任务。

更为关键的是,新的组织路线所强调的年轻化和专业化不仅有助于为党的领导干部队伍注入思想开放、精力充沛和素质过硬的新生力量,而且还有助于加强政治锦标赛的激励效应。相对年轻的领导干部在事业和仕途上有更长远的打算,职业前景激励(career concerns)自然更强,对政治锦标赛的激励设计的反应也更大。80年代初以来,中央一再提出要大力选拔年轻干部进入党政领导岗位,明文规定各级党政领导班子中年轻人应该占据的比例,其目的在于通过新老更替为党的组织队伍注入新鲜血液,克服干部队伍固化容易产生的惰性,制造“鲶鱼效应”,保持政治锦标赛持久的激励效应。对地方领导干部的年度绩效考核则有利于鼓励他们大力推动当地的经济发展,做好本部门的工作。

关于中国何以在三十年的时间里就创造了一个经济奇迹,有些经济学家追溯到改革开放初期中国所拥有的一些独特优势和基础。比如诺贝尔经济学奖获得者阿马蒂亚·森提出,中国在“文革”时期推行的乡村赤脚医生制度,让中国以较低廉的成本建立了一个非常有效的农村公共卫生防疫和治疗体系,为中国改革开放准备了庞大雄厚的健康资本。[^27] 也就是说,中国在改革之初享受了许多发展中国家没有的“人口健康红利”。基于前面对于中国干部人事制度改革的描述,我想提出,在改革开放初期,从中央到地方大规模领导干部新老更替为中国创造了一个巨大的“干部流动性红利”。这个流动性红利体现在80年代初从中央到地方大批老干部退出领导岗位,官场晋升通道突然打开,许多年轻干部被破格提拔。一人破格提拔,意味着后面有人填补,由此引发一系列的连锁反应,带动许多人的联动提拔和流动。年轻人只要政绩突出就可以比较容易得到提拔,甚至破格提拔,这无疑给年轻干部创造了美好的仕途前景和晋升希望。改革开放之初,计划体制尚占据主导地位,人们还普遍生活在保守僵化的思想观念之中,大规模启用新人和年轻人为突破体制束缚、创新改革思路注入了宝贵的魄力、勇气和热情。在这个意义上,干部流动性红利的重要性至少可以与人口健康红利相媲美。

政治锦标赛作为一种官场竞争的形式在中国的行政体制中一直存在,但是考核的指标、竞争方式、官员的退出方式等等在不同历史时期呈现很大的差异。我们前面也提到,在50年代的合作化运动、“大跃进”和人民公社化运动背后也有政治锦标赛的驱动,在60和70年代又有全国“农业学大大寨”和“工业学大庆”的学习热潮,地区之间的模仿、攀比和竞争自然离不开地方官员晋升竞争的推动。由此产生的一个问题是,改革开放之前和之后的两个政治锦标赛有何重要区别?为什么造成的经济后果如此不同?我们认为,这两个时期的政治锦标赛至少存在以下四个方面的重大区别:

首先是锦标赛竞争的参与形式不同。在毛泽东时代阶级斗争和路线斗争就像紧箍咒一样,官员整日提心吊胆,战战兢兢,如果表现不好,或者政治上不够积极,就可能被打成反革命或者右倾机会主义,不仅被撤职,还可能要面临牢狱之灾。更重要的是,在毛泽东时代地方官员没有退出权,既不能主动退出锦标赛竞争(如不谋求晋升或提前退居二线),也不能辞职到政府之外的部门工作(当时并不存在官员“下海”的机会)。在这种情况下,官员只能拼命跟进上面的政策,而且是以扭曲人格的极端方式参与政治竞争。邓小平时代则显著不同。改革开放之初,党内形成重要共识,即不再以阶级斗争和路线斗争处置绩效不好或犯有错误的官员。官员有了体面退出的机会。表现不好的官员,可以提前退休,也可以调整岗位,这就显著改变了竞争的激烈程度和参与方式。

第二个区别,在毛泽东时代,党内存在一个绝对的权威,毛泽东的权力凌驾于党中央之上。[^28] 改革开放之后这种绝对权威不复存在。如果存在一个绝对权威,大多数人会不惜一切投其所好,这是为什么在“大跃进”时期各地抢着放粮食卫星,亩产量从几万斤跃升至不可思议的十几万斤。高浮夸带来了高征购,最后导致了极端结果。改革开放后邓小平虽然是党的第二代领导核心和改革的总设计师,但是党内允许有不同观点的争论和不同改革策略的争论,为持不同观点的官员提供了不同政策选择,从而形成了一定的相互制衡,避免整个改革进程走向极端。在改革开放时期,政治锦标赛之下的地方官员面临更多的策略选择,官场竞争变得更加温和,更具建设性与包容性,避免了过于极端的策略选择与灾难性的后果。

第三个重要的区别是,毛泽东时代的政治锦标赛是在计划经济的环境下进行的,缺乏价格信号这样的信息传递和市场调节机制,引导资源的合理配置,同时反馈资源配置的结果。计划经济时期的基建投资,完全是行政分配,因为没有市场价格信号,无法保证投资效益和配置效率,而当重大的资源错配发生时信息反馈又严重滞后。改革开放以来的政治锦标赛发生在中国经济日益市场化和全球化的背景下,官员之间的经济竞争最终还是要依托企业和市场,效率高低要经过市场检验,最后竞争的结果也会通过一系列经济信号(如地区人均收入、地方债务、财政赤字、企业盈亏、企业倒闭)表现出来。如果某个地区或行业出现重大投资失误,最终会演化为政府债务、银行坏账、企业亏损甚至工人失业这些可观察的经济信号,提醒和促使相关方面采取必要的应对措施,避免更严重的问题发生。[^29]

最后是官员考核的内容发生了巨大变化。“大跃进”时期地方官员竞争围绕着粮食和钢铁产量,为了实现这些非常狭隘的经济指标,牺牲了许多其他指标,严重扭曲了资源配置的效果。“大跃进”时期为了完成不切实际的钢铁产量,各地大兴“小高炉”炼钢,甚至家家户户拿出做饭的铁锅去炼钢,炼出大量废钢废铁,就是这方面的一个例子。改革开放以来考核地方官员强调经济发展的绩效,如GDP和财政收入增长至少是高度综合性的经济指标,包含所有经济活动所创造的市场附加值,虽然也会带来环境、教育、医疗等方面的扭曲效应,但是相对粮食、钢铁这些单一具体的指标而言,其全面性和广泛性不言而喻,因此造成的经济扭曲效应也要小得多。

## 5.4 干部交流制度及其影响

80年代初逐步形成了干部定期交流制度。干部交流制度的起因是1982年冬,陕西省农村工作部副部长王伯惠等两位同志针对榆林地区领导干部长期在一地任职或本地任职面临的种种弊端,写信给当时的中组部部长宋任穷,建议建立县以上干部定期交流制度。陈云看到这封信的摘要后做了重要批示:交流制度好;一个干部长期在一个地方工作并不好,容易形成帮派。县级以上也应该轮换(陈凤楼,2003,第257—258页)。中央组织部根据陈云的重要批示提出,要结合机构改革,对县级主要领导干部有计划地进行交流。继续留任的县委正副书记、正副县长中,至少有1/3的人在省、市、自治区或地区范围里交流。根据中组部的精神,许多地方有计划、有步骤地对县、地两级党委、政府以及部分职能部门的领导干部实行了异地交流。据统计,山东、河南、黑龙江、山西、上海、福建、广西等省、区、市,继续留任的县委正副书记、正副县长有1/3进行了交流。经过交流,县级党政领导班子中在原籍任职和长期在一地任职的干部大为减少。山东省从1983年至1988年交流的县级党政干部469人,占全省县(市)党政正副职总数的46%;山西省截至1986年,一共交流地市党政干部51人,占总数的36%,交流县级领导干部417人,占总数的43%(陈凤楼,第258页)。到1988年,全国近十个省市初步建立了党政干部的交流制度。

进入90年代以后,以前主要集中于省内的干部异地交流逐渐发展到跨省区之间的干部交流,而且是发达地区与欠发达地区之间的对口双向交流。1991年初,江苏省委与陕西省委共同协商,决定对口双向选派干部,进行交流。江苏从苏南选派了73名干部到陕南地区工作,帮助当地政府和企业沟通,吸引投资,发展经济;陕南地区也相应地选派73名干部到苏南地区对口挂职锻炼,学习发达地区改革开放的经验。这146名挂职干部还带动了两地31个县大批基层干部相互学习、参观和交流。苏陕干部的交流很快在全国引起了极大的反响,其他省市自治区纷纷仿效,自愿结对,双向交流。到1993年底,全国共有29个省市自治区近万名干部参与了交流(陈凤楼,第295—296页)。

进入90年代中期以后,干部定期交流制度进一步规范化,交流的范围和力度进一步加强。1999年中组部下发《党政领导干部交流工作暂行规定》,重点推行党政正职领导干部以及重要部门(如组织人事、纪检监察、财政、工商、公安)领导干部的交流。一些重点岗位和重要职务需要实行干部交流、回避、轮岗制度。具体交流对象主要包括以下几类情况:第一类是需要通过交流丰富领导经验、提高领导水平的,这包括拟提拔担任县(处)级以上党政领导职务、但又没有基层工作经历的干部,以及新提拔担任县(市、区)以上党政领导干部。第二类是在一个地方或部门工作时间较长(任职满10年)的党政或部门领导干部。第三类是按规定需要回避的,比如新提拔担任县(市)委书记、县(市)长职务的干部,一般不得在本人成长地任职,有夫妻关系、直系血亲关系、三代以内旁系血亲以及近姻亲关系等亲属关系,如双方在同一领导班子任职,或在同一单位担任直接隶属于同一领导人的职务,或有直接上下级领导关系职务的,其中一方必须交流。据统计,1995年至2000年5月,全国96%的县(市、区)委书记、97%的县(市、区)长进行了交流或易地任职(中共中央组织部研究室,2004)。

官员任职的回避制度是中国历史上官员治理的一个长期措施。但新中国成立以来的很长时间里,干部任职的回避制度基本废除不用了。到了90年代以后,这个古老的制度又重新被启用,说明其背后一定有它的合理性,比如避免任职官员与当地的亲属、朋友和同学之间结成利益关系网络,滋生腐败,影响施政的公正、公平和公开原则。

易地交流主要针对那些年龄较轻、尚有培养前途的党政领导干部,如果县(处)级党政干部年龄超过50岁、地(厅)级以上(含地厅级)党政领导干部年龄超过55岁的,一般不易地交流。

从干部交流的范围看,地(厅)级干部一般应在本省(自治区、直辖市)内交流,根据工作需要,也可跨省交流;县(处)级干部一般应在地(市、州)范围内交流,根据工作需要,也可跨地(市、区)交流;县(市)委书记、县(市)长应跨地(市、州)交流。

干部定期易地交流制度的推行和完善是中国干部人事管理制度在新时期的一项极其重要的创新。干部易地交流有很多好处。从领导者个人的层面上看,最明显的是干部通过易地交流可以丰富阅历,积累经验,尤其是从落后地区到发达地区的交流,可以更新领导干部的施政观念和知识储备,大大开阔施政思路和视野。

领导者的人力资本有计划、有步骤的跨地区横向流动,有助于缩小地区之间发展水平的差异。从发达地区选派干部到落后地区,先进的施政理念和丰富的人际资源也就带到了落后地区。干部交流制度对于促进被交换地区的经济增长有着积极作用,这一结论获得了系统的经验研究的支持(徐现祥等,2007;张军等,2007)。

过去经济学家在解释地区之间经济发展的收敛性时,更多强调的是市场的力量,如资本和劳动力的自由流动会消除地区间的差异。但在实际发展过程中,我们经常看到的不是熟练劳动力和资本从发达地区自动流入落后地区,而是从落后地区流动到发达地区。中国的经济发展过程也见证了这一论断。长久以来被人们关注的中西部地区的人才外流的问题(即“孔雀东南飞”现象)和资金大量外流问题(即落后地区严重的“存贷差”现象)说明了这一点。领导干部的定期交流制度在一定程度上可以理解为政府对领导者人力资本流动的人为干预,这不是市场自动产生的流动,而是人为干预的结果,有助于纠正地区发展日益加大的失衡。

上述的讨论主要强调干部易地交流的知识和学习效应,这是最容易看到的收益。它的另外一个较为明显的收益是,干部交流可以有助于克服领导干部在一地任职时间过长容易带来的拉帮结派和裙带主义。由于历史上形成的“一元化”领导和“一把手”现象,地方党政首脑的权力受到的监督和制约非常有限,这为权力腐败和公权私用营造了有利环境。如果领导干部在某地长期任职,很容易在其周围形成一个私人关系网,滋生种种腐败现象,而且这些腐败经常表现为“官官相护”的窝案。领导干部横向流动显然有助于打破这种关系网和裙带主义的生成和发展。经常轮换干部还有助于上级领导获得可能被前任干部隐藏的信息(Huang,2002),因而成为上级政府治理下属官员的重要手段。事实上,少数领导干部为包庇其下属的贪腐行为而经常阻挠上级检查部门的调查。为了便于查处一些官员的腐败案件,一个常用的办法是将腐败嫌疑人的上级领导调离岗位,使得案件得以顺利侦破。

从政治锦标赛和官员治理的角度看,干部定期易地交流还有更深层的好处。首先,干部定期易地交流可以减弱地方官员因为晋升博弈的零和性而从事恶性竞争的程度。我们后面会详细讨论,政治晋升主要涉及在大量竞争者中提拔有限数目的候选人,一人所得往往是另一人所失,在这种情况下,为了获得竞争的胜利,参与人可能会竭尽全力,甚至不惜采取“拆台”式的非合作手段。“拆台”式非合作手段表现在不同地区地方官员之间,就是地方保护主义和重复建设之类的恶性竞争行为,对地区经济发展带来非常严重的负面影响。如果地方官员预期到自己在一个地区任期有限,干一段时间之后很可能会调离,甚至到竞争地区去任职,就不会“誓死力争”,而是给自己“留条后路”。[^30]

其次,对于那些经常发生的干部对调行为,定期交流还有助于强化政治锦标赛的激励效应。我们经常可以看到领导干部之间的岗位对调,比如河南省委书记与辽宁省委书记的对调,或一个省内两个地级市的领导对调。为什么会有干部平级对调?这其中当然有上面谈及的丰富施政经验、减少裙带主义、减弱恶性竞争的原因。

除此之外,我认为还有一个值得强调的原因,那就是强化政治锦标赛的激励效应。

为了解释清楚这背后的逻辑,让我们考虑下面一个简化的例子。设想两个地区A和B,各有一个行政首脑a和b,他们处于同级的晋升竞争之中,他们各自辖区的经济增长速度谁更快,谁就更可能晋升。如果没有定期对调制度,a和b将根据本地区的发展条件和获胜的几率各自选择一个最优的努力水平。[^31] 现在假设他们预先知道在完成一期的工作之后双方要对调交流,然后在下一期继续进行晋升竞争,最后上级根据每个人两期的经济发展绩效决定谁是最终的优胜者。这时两人的理性计算将发生变化:在第一期,两人都会倾向于比没有定期对调制度时更加努力。这是因为,第一期更高的努力水平不仅提高了第一期的绩效,加大了晋升的概率,更重要的是,第一期更高的努力水平所导致的更高的绩效实际上为自己的对手在第二期设置了更高的基准水平。如果地方官员b在第二期的绩效低于a的第一期绩效水平,说明b的努力水平(或潜在能力)可能低于a的水平。

所以,政治锦标赛下的官员对调制度的“魔力”在于同时创造了两个层面上的相对绩效评估:一是在同一时期两个官员a和b在两地A和B发展经济的相对绩效差异,二是在同一地区A或者B两个官员之间的相对绩效差异。第一个相对绩效评估可以帮助上级政府在评估两个地方官员的绩效时剔除共同的影响因素(如宏观经济波动或中央政策的影响),减少评估的误差;第二个相对绩效评估则可以帮助上级政府在评判两人的绩效时剔除地区本身的固有差异(如发达地区与落后地区的差异),从而可以对两个地方官员的尽职程度以及能力水平做出更加准确的判断。从激励理论来说,如果上级政府(委托人)能够减少评判下级官员(代理人)努力程度的误差,那么,激励合约的效果可以进一步加强。事实上,给定上级政府从两个层面的相对绩效评估考察地方官员的尽职程度,地方官员的最优反应就是人为加大第一期的努力程度,这样一方面提高第一个层面的相对绩效评估获胜的概率,同时又降低了对手在第二个层面的相对绩效评估获胜的概率,可谓“一举两得”。

周黎安等(2005)利用中国1979—2002年省级水平的数据发现,省委书记和省长的晋升概率不仅取决于同一期不同地区的相对绩效,而且还取决于同一地区本任领导与前任领导的相对绩效,后者所占权重要显著得多。这可能反映了中国地区间差异性太大的事实,从而更加侧重第二个层面的相对绩效评估。而我们上面所研究的地方官员平级对调制度,从激励设计的角度看,非常巧妙地把两个层面的相对绩效评估机制同时结合在一起,使得地方官员在政治锦标赛下的激励效应进一步强化。这个激励效应的存在并不必然要求两个地区的地方官员的固定对调,所要求的关键条件是,地方官员事先就知道,到了一定时期就要和那些在同一级别的处于晋升竞争性关系的某个官员对调。换句话说,处于同一级别和同一个“劳动力市场”的干部易地交流的定期化是激励效应发生作用的条件。我们确实也看到了,绝大多数的地厅级领导干部的交流发生在省内,县(市)级领导干部的交流发生在地市范围之内,而且干部交流制度越来越定期化和制度化,这些事实正好说明,通过干部易地交流强化政治锦标赛的激励效应的条件是满足的。目前所有关于干部交流制度的研究都侧重于强调它的知识和学习效应,而忽略了它可能发挥的激励效应。

## 5.5 “官场+市场”模式

80年代以来中国经济开启了渐进的市场化改革。首先在企业层面上作为中国经济主体的国有企业朝着市场化方向不断改革。从转变经营机制开始,引入奖金制度、经理人承包制,到90年代股份制改革和建立现代公司治理结构,90年代后期中央提出“抓大放小”的国企改革思路,绝大多数的中小型国有企业被改制或拍卖,大量国企职工下岗。其次是产品市场和要素市场的逐渐放开,非国有企业大量进入制造业和服务业,劳动力和资金跨地区流动的制度约束逐渐减少,市场竞争不断加剧。再次是中国对外贸易的自由化,经济全面融入全球化进程。2001年正式加入世贸组织更是让中国的对外开放进入了一个崭新的发展阶段,对外依存度(进出口贸易占GDP的比重)2007年达到64%的惊人水平,中国经济进入了加速增长的轨道。近年来中国企业开始大规模走出去,在国外投资建厂或并购重组。所有这一切都意味着中国经济处于一个不断深化的市场化和全球化的进程之中,中国企业在国内外市场上面临激烈的竞争。考虑到国内大多数制造行业集中度低,动辄上千、上万家企业在一个行业内竞争,中国企业(尤其是非国有企业)所面临的市场竞争的激烈程度是惊人的。

另一方面,在中国经济的市场化进程中,各类企业一直受到各级地方政府的推动和影响。在中国,市场的“看不见的手”一直受到政府这只“看得见的手”(有时也被称为“闲不住的手”)的影响和左右。地方政府对市场的推动力和影响力是由地方政府在区域经济所处的核心地位决定的,地方政府是辖区内的资源掌控者和规则制定者,中国地方政府还具有准公司的性质。这里所谓的“准公司”性质是指地方政府所从事的主要活动及运作方式,与一家大型公司的日常工作有着极大的相似性:年初确立经济发展指标,制定产业结构政策,寻找战略和新兴产业,确定重大项目计划,争取各种融资渠道,年末进行相关人员考核和问责,工作重心都始终围绕着经济增长、重大产业项目、财政预算等经济工作展开。更重要的是,地方官员还处于围绕着经济发展的官场竞争之中。各地招商引资的竞争如火如荼,背后其实就是官员晋升竞争的驱动。

与所有其他经济体相比较,中国市场经济最独具特色的方面就是官场竞争与市场竞争的密切互动和高度结合,这个双层市场结构驱动着中国经济的运行。一方面,官场竞争的规则、方式以及激烈程度直接决定地方官员的晋升激励,进而影响地方官员推动辖区经济发展的努力,包括制定产业政策、投入基础设施、提高行政服务效率、提供土地和贷款支持,最后影响到辖区企业参与市场竞争的绩效结果;另一方面,辖区内所有企业通过市场竞争实现的绩效加总起来所形成的地区经济绩效(如GDP和财税增长)又会影响到官员在官场竞争的命运。官场竞争可能进一步加剧不同辖区企业间的市场竞争程度,比如政府的土地和资金支持使辖区企业在市场上采取更加激进的竞争策略,而市场竞争反过来不仅影响官场竞争的结果,还决定官员参与官场竞争的方式和策略。这两种不同性质的竞争过程相互纠缠、相互作用,极大地推动了中国经济的高速发展,也决定了中国市场化进程和经济运行的诸多重要而有趣的特征。

“官场+市场”提供了一个重要的分析框架去看待和解析中国特色的市场经济,有助于揭示政府内部官场竞争的游戏规则与中国经济的市场化进程两者之间的深刻联系。从这个视角出发,我们可以更加深入地理解中国经济增长所依赖的独特的制度基础。经济学家经常强调创新和企业家精神对于经济增长的决定性意义(Schumpter,1934;Aghion and Howitt,1998)。中国市场经济的发展当然需要无数民间企业家的创业与创新精神,市场竞争也时刻催生着民间企业家的涌现。与此同时,在经济转型与发展的过程中,尤其在早期阶段,我们也需要敢于引领制度和政策创新的政治企业家精神。一个地区的经济发展不仅需要地方政府的“亲商”态度与政策,更重要的是,如何利用其资源禀赋和制度条件发展优势产业,吸引人才和投资,克服市场失灵,进行制度和机制创新,提供良好的基础设施、政策环境,最终在地区经济竞争中胜出,这一切需要地方官员的战略眼光和创新思维。“官场+市场”模式恰好催生了这两类企业家精神及其结合:如果说官场竞争可以激发地方官员的政治企业家精神,那么,市场竞争激发的就是旺盛的民间企业家精神。正如在本章第一节所述,官员激励和政府治理是各国的难题,尤其在发展中国家,无能和低效的政府经常成为经济发展的主要杀手。中国地方官员的政治锦标赛通过在政府部门引入竞争机制而创造性给出了中国特色的解决方案。政治锦标赛总体上是比西方国家地方政府之间的“标尺竞争”更为激烈的竞争形式,随着中国诸生产要素跨地区流动性的加强,激烈的官场竞争有利于抑制地方政府低效率的行政服务,改善对于稀缺生产要素的行为态度和政策取向,在中国企业主要面临官僚主义和政府权力“合法伤害权”威胁的情况下,官场竞争是提高资源配置效率的一种重要力量。“官场+市场”的双层市场模式,就其积极意义而言,激发了政治企业家和民间企业家的创新冒险精神,实现了两者之间的友好握手,这是过去三十多年来中国经济快速增长并保持蓬勃活力的重要来源和制度基础。

第8章将讲述吉利汽车的创始人李书福的商业传奇故事,我们将看到李书福如何在“缺资金、缺技术、缺牌照”的艰难环境下,以民营企业家的身份挤入国企与外资垄断的汽车产业,进而在公司一路飞速发展的过程中获得地方官员给予的资金和政策的关键性支持。这里地方官员成了寻觅汽车产业发展之道的政治企业家,与被同行称为“汽车疯子”的民间企业家实现了真诚合作与相互支持,成就了中国汽车产业一段最传奇的故事。类似的故事在中国应该很多,任何一家民营企业在从小到大的成长过程中,如果离开了地方官员的支持和帮助,虽然说不是不可能,但一定是极其艰难的。我们还将看到,“官场+市场”模式如何导致了各级地方政府围绕着经济增长目标层层加码,将官场竞争的压力直接转化为地区间高速的经济增长。

当然,我们需要注意到,政治市场和经济市场虽然都是某种竞争形式,但显然服从不同的竞争逻辑,两者相互纠缠可能带来一系列复杂的影响。相比两个企业在市场上竞争,两个官员的官场竞争呈现以下三个方面的重要差异。首先,官场竞争更具零和性质,因而相互合作空间有限。试想两个官员只有一个官员可以最终晋升,那么这两个官员无法实现合作或合谋来增进双方的利益[^32] ,只有通过面对面的竞争,有时是以恶性的方式(如相互拆台),最终决出胜负。如果是市场上竞争的两家企业,只要合作的利润大于单独经营的利润,两家企业就可能合作,所以这种竞争属于正和博弈。第7章将专门讨论官员竞争如何对跨区域的竞争合作带来的负面影响。其次,官场竞争之下地方官员的激励和行为受到任期的约束,行为趋向于“短期化”。官员的一个任期正常是五年,但因为流动频繁,市县级主政官员的任期一般是3年左右,省级主政官员的任期是4年左右。通常来说,官员主要关心任期内的政绩,超出任期的政绩一般不会予以必要的关注,这意味着官场竞争有可能造成地方官员的短期化行为。过去二十年地方政府债务的大规模积累就反映了地方官员短期化行为的后果。企业家没有任期约束,其战略规划更可能反映企业长期发展的预期和利益。再次,地方官员主要关注锦标赛竞争所考核的绩效指标(如有关经济发展的硬指标),而对那些重要但未能纳入绩效考核体系的指标(如环境保护和民生)就会有所忽视,导致多任务的扭曲效应。对于企业竞争来说,利润最大化是企业的最重要的目标,有时难免也会出现企业为追求利润而无视政府监管和社会责任的情况。但地方政府的多任务性质比单纯作为经济赢利组织的企业要突出得多,因而多任务扭曲效应也更严重。[^33]

因为官场竞争与市场竞争遵循不同的逻辑,甚至相互冲突,所以官场竞争与市场竞争不是简单的互补关系,官场竞争的运行逻辑可能会扰乱和干预市场竞争的商业逻辑,从而为中国经济带来一系列负面的影响。事实上,过去三十多年来中国增长所带来的各种问题,诸如粗放式增长方式、环境污染、地方债累积、公共服务(如教育医疗和社会保障)供给不足,均属于“官场+市场”模式所产生的一系列消极影响,值得我们高度关注。

“官场+市场”作为一种分析框架赋予了我们深入研究中国特色的政经互动的独特视角和方法。“官场+市场”理论的一个直接推论是,官场竞争的规则、环境的变化或者处于官场竞争的地方官员的个人特征最终都会“映射”到市场竞争和地区竞争上,官场竞争与市场竞争存在密切的对应关系,如同两者之间存在函数关系一样。一些纯属于政府内部干部人事管理制度的一些改革,如引入“退居二线”制度,地方党委只允许设立一名专职副书记,干部提拔必须要有地方工作经验,县委书记高配(享受副厅级待遇)等等,按照我们“官场+市场”的分析逻辑,都程度不同地改变了官场竞争的游戏规则,影响到地方官员的晋升激励和策略,最终对地区经济竞争和市场竞争产生影响。第6章第4节讨论地方党代会周期与地区资源配置效率的关系,建立起官员轮替周期与地区产业配置效率的对应关系。第6章第5节将分析市级领导的年龄与城商行贷款数量与质量的关系,就是探讨在“退居二线”的潜规则之下地方官员接近临界年龄对银行贷款数量与质量的影响。

当然一个地区市场竞争的状态也会影响地方官员官场竞争的策略。试想一个地方官上任的地区以民营经济为主,市场化力量占据主导,那么地方官的竞争策略就是如何为企业和市场创造更友好的服务和监管环境。浙江义乌素有小商品贸易的传统,历届地方政府积极为小商品市场创造良好环境,建立商品交易城,征收较低的管理费,建立商铺的商誉评级,打击假冒伪劣行为,使得义乌成为全球最大的商品交易城(陆立军等,2014)。如果一个地区国有企业占据主导,政商环境差,想在短时间做大地方经济,地方官的策略可能就是进一步发展国有企业,以国有企业的投资和数量扩张实现经济增长。这是东北地区近年来陷入增长低迷、人口外流困境的深层原因。第8章我们将看到政商环境、官员行为与地区发展如何内生地相互作用,形成地区间不同的发展绩效。

中国经济转型发展中的政府与企业关系、官员与企业家的关系,一直是学者和社会舆论关注的焦点问题。“官场+市场”理论提供了解析这个重要问题的独特视角。因为政治锦标赛和官场竞争聚焦于人,晋升激励落实到人,官员的个人特征直接映射到晋升激励的强弱,进而影响地区经济发展的条件和环境,而民营企业家做大企业绩效也是对主政官仕途的直接贡献。在中国这样一个特殊的“人治”社会,“官场+市场”的模式必然塑造极具特色的人格化的官商关系,尤其是地方官员和民营企业家的关系。因此,过去三十年地方政府与企业的关系从非人格化的政企关系逐渐演化为兼具制度化和人格化的官商关系。[^34]

关于政府与市场关系,以及中国经济发展过程中政府所发挥的独特作用,经济学、政治学和社会学领域过去二十多年积累了大量的文献。“官场+市场”作为一种新的分析框架放在这些文献里有何理论贡献呢?下面我们试图回答这个问题。

“官场+市场”理论重新诠释了中国式政府与市场的关系的特征及其影响。我们在第1章已经讨论了国内外学者关于政府与市场关系的研究,学者们对政府与市场之间是互补还是替代关系一直存有争议。中国国家层面定期推出的经济发展规划(如五年规划)和产业政策,与日本、韩国的政府与市场的作用模式有诸多相似之处,如“日本股份公司”“韩国股份公司”“发展型国家”,加之中国也像日韩一样在国家层面出台政策支持企业的“出口导向”战略,人们很容易把中国的发展模式归入“东亚模式”的范畴。从“官场+市场”的视角出发,我们显然不同意这种类比,因为它只看到了中国与日本、韩国在国家层面的相似之处,而忽略了两者之间的重大区别。

考虑到地方政府在中国政府体制和经济发展过程中的独特地位和作用,如果借用“日本股份公司”的比喻,那么,关于中国政府与市场关系更准确的描述应该是“竞争性地方股份公司”模式。[^35] 这个描述既包含了不同辖区企业之间的竞争,也包含了不同辖区地方官员之间的竞争,以及同一辖区内地方政府与企业之间紧密的战略联盟关系。用“竞争性地方股份公司”概括中国经济发展的模式,既让我们看到中国与日韩“国家股份公司”模式之间的相似性,如政府与企业的紧密关系,积极的产业政策,贷款优惠、财政补贴等政策工具的广泛运用,同时也很容易看到两种模式之间的重要区别。首先,“国家股份公司”模式更容易在中央政府层面统一推出产业政策及其配套的政策工具,也更容易在全国层面上形成巨型企业和寡头性的市场结构。日本的三菱、三井、松下、东芝,韩国的三星、现代,促成政治家与财阀家族之间的紧密关系、巨型企业在国内市场的寡头甚至垄断地位以及海外市场的高度竞争力。这种政治家与财阀的紧密关系也使得寻租和腐败难以避免。在中国的“竞争性地方股份公司”模式之下,国家层面的产业政策在地方层面上出现显著的多样性和差异化,地方上各具特色的产业政策和发展重点是地方政府之间经济竞争的重要内容。产业政策在地方上分散化试验和尝试降低了国家层面系统犯错的风险,而不同地区间的激烈竞争也为各地区产业政策的选择和执行注入了更多市场竞争的因素,比如政府政策和实施机制的创新,更多利用经济手段促进产业发展,地区间官员围绕先进经验的模仿和学习效应等等。当然,中国模式的独特因素——官场竞争——以及它的恶性竞争性质可能会引致地区间政策协调失败、产业趋同、企业过度进入和资源浪费。“竞争性地方股份公司”模式虽然也导致地方官员与辖区企业之间的紧密关系,也极可能造成寻租和腐败,但辖区地方政府有限的资源、注定分散化的市场结构及激烈竞争也在一定程度上限制了寻租和腐败的规模及其负面影响。

戴慕珍(Oi,1992,1995)基于中国乡村工业的崛起过程中地方政府与乡镇企业的紧密关系,提出了“地方政府社团主义”(Local State Corporatism)的概念。戴慕珍认为,考虑乡村工业的发展,可以把县级政府当做公司的总部,各乡镇是区域性分公司和相对独立的“利润中心”,乡镇企业就是分公司之下的实体企业,在这样一个经济管理结构之中党委是权力中心。Che和Qian(1998)也强调要理解乡镇企业的特性,必须站在乡镇社区的角度,将乡镇政府作为公司总部,乡镇企业作为分公司。这些理论概括和描述与我们的“竞争性地方股份公司”有一定的关联,但这些概念主要强调了地方政府与辖区企业之间的紧密关系,而我们所提出的“竞争性地方股份公司”不仅强调地方政府与辖区企业(包括民营企业和外资企业)的战略联盟关系,更强调不同辖区之间地方官员和企业之间分别在官场和市场的竞争关系,这是我们与这些文献最重要的区别。

中国的“官场+市场”的政经互动格局必然使得政府与市场的边界变得极其模糊,在现实中两者相互嵌入,相互纠缠,难分彼此。我们很难简单地说中国的地方政府与市场之间是互补还是替代关系,在更多的场合它们是合作和联盟的关系。至于这种合作与联盟关系是否一定带来双赢的结果,其实也无法完全保证,具体取决于官员和企业的双边特征以及地区的制度环境。这里主要有两方面的因素在起作用:一是官场竞争和市场竞争有助于约束官员的任性、合法伤害和“单边主义”的干预,但这些约束的强度取决于官员的晋升激励强度和企业对于辖区政府的依赖度;二是政府与企业、市场在权力上的不对等关系,官员在一些极端情况下可能会做出直接伤害企业的举动。我们在第8章将提供一些政企关系的案例,具体解析导致双方合作出现不同结果的原因和背景。

“官场+市场”理论与林毅夫教授提出的新结构主义经济学理论也有一定的关联(林毅夫,2012)。新结构主义经济学主要在国家层面研究一国的资源禀赋、比较优势与最优产业结构之间的关系,强调政府应该积极有为,推行基于资源禀赋和比较优势的产业政策,促进国家的经济发展。这个理论的逻辑应该也在一国的地区层面上适用。中国的地方政府是地区产业政策的制定者和推动者,我们也确实看到地方政府根据资源禀赋和制度条件选择本地区优先发展的产业,而且在这个过程中,地方政府在克服协调失败等市场失灵方面发挥了重要作用。但是,“官场+市场”理论也同时强调了地方官员在选择“最优”产业结构时所面临的官场竞争压力和晋升激励约束,而这些方面的考虑不足是新结构主义解释中国地区产业结构和经济发展的局限性。由于地方官员在决定地区“最优”产业政策的时候受制于官场竞争的压力,受制于地方官员自身的晋升激励,受制于晋升考核的指标体系,因此最终选择的产业政策并不一定是地区资源禀赋所对应的具备比较优势的产业。换言之,从社会计划者的视角考察的地区最优产业政策是新结构主义理论所倡导的,它基于地区资源禀赋、市场竞争与比较优势的逻辑,也许可以为地方官员提供有益的备选方案和政策咨询,但不一定满足地方官员的激励相容约束,身在官场的官员在政治竞争压力之下极可能选择与之偏离的产业政策。从“官场+市场”的视角看,地区产业政策其实就是地方官员晋升竞争的一个策略变量。这里最重要的区别是,从社会计划者角度计算的产业比较优势(比如基于资源禀赋和要素成本)与地方官员基于官场竞争和经济政绩视角计算的产业比较优势并不必然一致。官场竞争的零和博弈性质可能导致过度的政府补贴和产业的过度进入,而以短期GDP增长为追求目标未必与比较优势的原则一致。我们第7章将讨论区域经济互动中的地方保护主义和重复建设问题。单纯讨论基于地区资源禀赋的产业政策,忽略了嵌入市场竞争的官场竞争对产业政策制定者所施加的影响,如同考察政治家的经济决策而忽略其个人动机和政治约束一样,难免过于理想。[^36] 内生化政府官员或政治家的经济决策是我们理解国家和地区产业政策的重要条件。

美国著名社会学家马克·格兰诺维特(Mark Granovetter)指出,市场经济是嵌入在一定的社会网络和社会结构之中,因而出现比单纯的市场经济更为复杂的特征(Granovetter,1985)。按照“官场+市场”的分析框架,中国的市场经济不仅嵌入在复杂的社会网络和结构之中,更重要是深嵌在官场竞争之中,所呈现的特征既区别于发达国家,又区别于发展中国家。官场与市场的相互嵌入也同时改变了两者原有的特征和性质。因为有官场竞争动力的叠加,不同辖区的企业在市场上的竞争变得更为激烈(比如地方官员给辖区内企业财政补贴、廉价土地、贷款优惠、推动上市等支持其在市场上的竞争)。官场竞争的嵌入有可能导致民营企业出现“软预算约束”的症状,企业亏损但仍然获得政府的资金救助,其制度性质与科尔奈研究的国有企业基于政府“父爱主义”的软预算约束显然不同。与此同时,官场竞争也是在市场竞争的约束下进行,官员要取得好于竞争对手的经济绩效也必须依托市场,通过企业在市场上竞争所获得的收入打造其经济绩效;不管官员如何扶持企业,如何做大辖区的GDP和财政收入,最终必须经受市场的严格检验。市场竞争的结果在相当程度上决定了官员的经济绩效。市场逻辑的嵌入限制了官场竞争的恶性程度、过度任性和资源浪费。

总之,“官场+市场”作为一种分析框架,从政治锦标赛理论延伸而来,超越了传统理论聚焦于地方政府的视角,而是深入考察政府内部官场竞争的结构性特征以及官员的个体特征,建立从官场竞争、官员激励到市场竞争和中国经济的双向映射关系。这为我们理解中国特色的市场经济、区域和宏观经济运行的特征以及政企关系提供了一个独特的观察视角。它也有非常重要的政策含义,那就是组织部门在设计干部人事管理制度的新规则、新内容的时候,必须把地方官员的理性反应以及对中国经济可能造成的影响考虑进去,时刻从“官场+市场”的视角分析问题和设计对策。

# 6 中国特色的政经互动

在中国,地方官员在官场上相互竞争,企业在市场上相互较量;同一地区的地方官员与企业结成紧密的同盟关系,而跨地区间的官员与企业又形成激烈的竞争关系,由此我们以“竞争性地方股份公司”来概括地方官员与企业之间的复杂关系。政府内部的官场竞争与市场上的企业竞争如此紧密地联系在一起,官场与市场双轮驱动对一国经济运行的特征和绩效产生如此深刻的影响,这在世界范围内也是独一无二的。从本章至第8章我们将采用“官场+市场”的分析视角,系统研究中国独具特色的市场经济、政经互动、区域竞争与合作以及政企关系。

本章将聚焦于一组典型的“官场+市场”现象,如各级地方政府围绕着经济增长指标的“层层加码”现象,我们可以看到地方官员的官场竞争如何直接导致不断加码的增长目标和实际增长率;还有官员任期、党代会周期如何带来了地区投资和资源错配的周期性波动,地方官员的年龄与银行信贷数量与质量的内在关联,经营城市与土地财政,官员晋升激励与城市空间扩张特征的关系等等。

## 6.1 “层层加码”现象

如前所述,政治锦标赛的一个显著特征是地方官员的激励效应逐级放大,即所谓的“层层加码”,比如当一个经济增长目标经中央政府提出后,它会沿着地方政府的层级而逐级加码和放大。基于这个有趣的观察,我和我的合作者做了一些后续研究,试图对中国多层级政府间层层加码现象进行系统的验证并提供相应的理论解释(Li et al., 2012;Li et al., 2016;周黎安等,2015a)。

我们将研究的焦点放在从中央到省区、市、县多层级之间的经济增长目标,数据取自各级政府公布的政府工作报告和五年规划。表6.1列出了从“七五”规划至“十二五”规划中央和省级政府提出的年度平均经济增长目标,作为对照,表6.1也列出了从“七五”规划至“十一五”规划省平均实际增长率。

我们可以看到,在所有列举的五年计划时期,省级政府提出的目标增长率平均说来都超过了中央提出的增长目标,而且随着时间的推移,省级政府的加码幅度有逐渐扩大的趋势。在“七五”规划制定时期,全国尚有6个省区公布的增长目标低于中央目标。80年代中期,关于中国是否走市场化改革的道路,从中央到地方还有很大的争论,省级领导中还有改革派和保守派之分,所以省级政府对于中央增长目标的加码还是比较温和的。但自从党的十三大中央确立了走社会主义市场经济的道路之后,尤其是邓小平南方谈话之后,“经济发展是硬道理”,地方政府围绕着经济增长的竞争日益激烈。这反映在省级政府的五年计划目标上,南方谈话之后对于中央目标的加码幅度平均接近30%,有一些省区甚至超出了50%,而且几乎所有省级政府报出的增长目标都高于中央。在“八五”计划(南方谈话前)和“九五”计划只有一个省份的目标值低于中央,在“十五”和“十二五”则是所有省区政府的目标值都超过了中央。

表6.1还比较了省级实际完成值和目标值,有两个基本发现。第一,在省级水平上,除“七五”之外,五年计划时期实际完成的GDP增长平均说来都超额完成了计划之初设定的目标值,平均高出2.5个百分点。第二,除了一些特殊情况,大多数省级政府都超额完成了GDP增长计划,在“十五”和“十一五”各省都超额完成了既定的目标。

表6.1清楚地说明了一个重要事实:在中央确立经济增长目标之后,省级政府将在此基础上不同程度地进行加码,但这只是地方政府竞争博弈的一部分,在做出目标许诺之后各地方政府还必须竭尽全力超额完成已经加码的任务。因此,对于省级政府来说,五年计划的制定和实施是一个两阶段的竞争博弈:不仅需要在制定计划阶段竞相做出“高姿态”,立下“雄心壮志”,在兑现阶段还必须想尽一切办法超额完成。

给定省政府提出的增长目标,市级政府又会如何反应?周黎安等(2015a)列出了2003—2010年省市两级政府的目标和实际完成的GDP增长率。[^1] 市级政府的平均目标增长率要高于省级目标均值2.05%—3.39%,超出部分占省级目标的20%以上。在实际完成方面,除2008年市级实际完成值略低于目标值0.156%之外,我们看到省市两级的实际完成情况都超过了增长目标。如果我们对2003—2010年分年、分省的省市两级目标和实际增长率进行比较,得到的结果也是一致的。由此可以认为,市级政府对于省级政府的加码在全国范围内是一个极其普遍的现象,而非某些省份的特殊现象。我们同样可以对市县两级政府目标与实际完成的GDP增长率进行比较。周黎安等(2015a)在东、中、西部各选取了一个省,东部选取了福建,中部选取了山西,西部选取了甘肃。对这些省的相关数据进行比较后发现,县级目标普遍高出1—2个百分点,而市级目标普遍高出省级目标1—3个百分点。

综合上述经验事实,我们可以确立经济增长目标在多级政府间层层加码的真实性和普遍性。“层层加码”现象的出现与我国“层层发包”的行政体制和多层级的官员政治锦标赛有着内在的关联。中国行政体制所呈现的“层层发包”的特征正好对应着“下管一级”的干部考核和任命制度:中央负责省级官员的考核和任命,省级负责市级干部,以此类推。当中央确定某个重要的施政目标,各级地方政府按照“逐级传达,层层动员”的模式,对上级政府做出承诺,上级政府最后问责直接的下级政府。“层层发包”的行政体制是“层层加码”现象经常发生的一个基本的制度背景。但是,“层层加码”现象的最终出现还必须取决于地方官员激励的性质,而这与中国多层级的政治锦标赛紧密相关。

从地方官员的角度看,从基层政府开始的政治晋升之路就如同一个逐级淘汰的政治锦标赛,为了晋级下一轮的竞争,必须保证本轮的优胜,而一旦因为某种原因“出局”,就意味着未来机会的彻底丧失。为了成功晋升,在强调GDP绩效的考核标准下,他们需要保证交出更好的“成绩单”才有可能。由于晋升的机会总是有限的,上级政府在考核下级的绩效和表现、决定提拔谁的时候,必然采用某种程度的“相对绩效评估”。使自己的经济绩效高过竞争对手是获得政治晋升的重要途径。中国政府结构的另外一个特征是,当中央以经济绩效考核省级主要官员的时候,省级官员为了争取更好的经济绩效,也会要求其下属的地级市官员提供好的经济绩效,在市级主要官员之间展开一个围绕着经济增长的政治竞争。同样,市级政府会在县级主要官员之间组织经济竞争。所以,政治锦标赛是在多层级间同时进行的。

当中央宣布一个增长目标的时候,从省级官员来看,这个目标充其量就是全国未来增长的平均数。为了在省级经济竞争中胜出,省级政府必须宣布一个高于全国平均值的目标,否则一开始就会在竞争中处于下风。省级官员即使预期到下级政府会在其目标上加码,也必须提出一个高出中央的目标,因为别的省份也面临同样的加码情况。发生在中央—省层面的加码逻辑可以完全推广到省—市和市—县两个层面。这就解释了为什么会有层层加码的现象产生。

上述理论解释可以推出几个可以检验的理论假说。第一,对于相对年轻的地方官员,因其未来的仕途更长,职业前景激励(career concerns)越强,面对中央的目标,可能会公布一个相对较高的增长目标。第二,在担任现职之前在上级政府工作的经历会减弱提出高指标的激励,因为作为考核方的上级会比较了解该官员。第三,其他条件不变,任期接近结束的官员越可能提出高目标,因为此时的高姿态会给上级留下好印象,而且因为任期可能结束,自己不必在未来“兑现”许诺,提出高目标面临的约束更少一些。周黎安等(2015a)对这些理论预测进行了实证检验,发现了相一致的经验结果,从而为“层层加码”现象与官员激励之间建立必要的联系。

揭示层层加码现象对于我们理解中国经济的运行特征有着重要意义,这直接提供了地方官员官场竞争如何引发地区间经济竞争的经验证据。以此为视角,我们还可以解析一系列与此相联系的重要经济现象。这里我们试举几例加以说明。

首先我们想利用层层加码的现象解释在2008年金融危机冲击之下中国经济的迅速回升。2008年下半年金融危机爆发之后,全球经济陷入严重的经济衰退,中国经济也面临出口下滑和增长滞缓的严峻形势。但经过不到两年的努力,中国经济在世界范围内率先企稳复苏,2009年的GDP增长率达到8.7%,2010年超过10%,与此相对照的是,西方主要经济体却还在面临如何摆脱经济衰退的难题。为什么中国经济能够在全球率先复苏,其中原因肯定是多方面的。有一个明显的原因就是中国政府在2008年11月份出台了4万亿人民币的经济刺激方案及其他一系列产业振兴规划。关于4万亿经济刺激计划的重要性毋庸置疑,但需要指出的是,西方的许多国家也有程度不同的政府刺激计划,比如美国奥巴马政府也出台了8000亿美元的联邦经济刺激计划。

为什么美国的联邦刺激计划的效果不那么明显呢?一个可能的解释是美国8000亿美元刺激计划占美国GDP总量的相对规模不如中国大。但这只是一个方面。我们认为,中美之间还有一个核心的差异被人们忽略了:就在中国中央政府出台4万亿刺激计划一个月的时间内,省区地方政府也竞相出台了各自的经济刺激计划,省级政府的刺激计划之和超过了20万亿,各地利用中央刺激内需的机会掀起经济大跃进的投资热潮。[^2] 由于全球金融危机对中国东部沿海地区冲击较大,而中西部地区所受影响相对有限,中西部地区利用中央经济刺激的大环境,试图实现对东部地区的“弯道赶超”。也就是说,中央经济刺激计划引发了中国地区间围绕着经济复苏的政治竞争,省级政府20万亿的刺激计划的总和是官场竞争驱动的层层加码的一个表现而已。在美国则是另外一种政府间互动的场景:当联邦政府增加支出、刺激需求的时候,州和地方政府因为财政收入缩水而不得不大幅度削减政府支出。据统计,州和地方政府支出的削减规模与联邦政府的刺激规模大致相当,致使政府刺激总需求的净效果微乎其微(Stiglitz,2010,p.63)。也就是说,中国地方政府对于中央刺激计划的加码使得政府对于经济的刺激规模远远大于公布的4万亿。当规模空前的资金在短时间内注入经济体,经济企稳复苏就是必然的结果了。

其次,我们想结合层层加码现象理解中国宏观经济的波动性问题。[^3] 中国宏观经济波动的一个重要特征是,经济不是处于过冷就处于过热的状态(刘霞辉,2004)。有研究表明,中国宏观经济的周期性变化与地方政府换届有着密切关系,地方政府的行为是中国经济波动冲击源的重要部分(李斌等,2006;李猛、沈坤荣,2010;Li,2012)。从我们的官场与市场的互动逻辑来看,中国宏观经济的波动性过大与各级地方官员的层层加码行为密切相关,增长目标的“层层加码”是经济过热的制度根源,而面对经济过热和预算软约束的地方官员,中央只能采取“一刀切”式行政手段对经济进行强行降温,这又导致了经济过冷。这是因为,每次全国党代会都是各级政府官员新老更替较为集中的时间,当中央政府设立一定的经济增长目标之后,新上任的官员有更大的激励提高本辖区的经济增长率(即所谓的“新官上任三把火”),从中央到地方就可以看到经济增长目标的层层加码的“热潮”,与此相伴随的是投资热情的层层加码,这是宏观经济过热的前兆。层层加码是推动经济过热的关键性因素。

最后,层层加码现象的研究也有助于我们更好地理解中国GDP数据的“注水”问题。近十年来,中国官方公布的GDP数据与各省统计的GDP数据的总和之间一直存在地方GDP之和大于国家公布的GDP的奇怪现象,缺口大约在3%—9%之间。国家统计局的官员也承认其中不排除地方官员造假的成分(李德水,2004)。从我们的视角看,政府间层层加码也许就是GDP数据层层注水的背后推手。各级地方官员在经济增长目标“加码”阶段迫于竞争压力必须报出一个较高的数值,在兑现目标阶段还必须制造足够的“惊奇”,即尽可能超额完成目标增长率,一些地方官员在增长率低于预期的情况下可能不惜“铤而走险”,为数据注水。我们的研究预言,这种数据造假压力也是随着政府层级而不断加大的。

关于层层加码现象的研究从一个新的视角揭示了中国政府层级间纵向关系的重要特征。关于中国政府间的关系,国内政治学一个非常有影响的观点是“压力型体制”(荣敬本等,1998),即从上级政府到下级政府,政府的目标和责任是通过行政手段一级一级往下摊派和施压来实现的。该观点强调了政府间因为权力的等级性而出现了“层层施压”的特征,所谓“官大一级压死人”,下级政府只能被动接受。我们不否认这种情况的大量存在,但是必须指出,这种观点只揭示了政府内部等级关系的一个方面。在许多情况下,下级官员为了晋升的考虑而主动要求加压,不断加码上级分配的指标和任务,以此获取一个更好的印象和表现。下级政府积极主动地响应上级要求与目标是“层层加码”现象所传递的、不同于“压力型体制”的重要讯息。另外需要指出的是,中国多层级政府体制因官场竞争而内生的“层层加码”是一把双刃剑,我们必须特别注意其负面效果,特别是在基层政府层面上体现出来的。如果上级政府目标制定过高,或者强行执行某些目标,会引起下级政府不惜代价地“跟风”和“加码”,所谓“上有所好,下必甚焉”;如果压力过大,必然导致下级政府作假、走过场、作秀等各种扭曲行为,造成巨大的行政成本和经济浪费。

“层层加码”作为中国多层级政府结构的独特现象,不仅发生在改革开放以来的经济增长目标上,还广泛出现在各式各样的行政和经济指标上。新中国建立之初的“合作化”运动、1958年的“大跃进”和“人民公社化”的运动中,在地方官员的晋升竞争中,层层加码现象是其中一个核心特征(周飞舟,2009)。对于中央提出的任务指标,如高级合作社的数目、粮食产量、钢铁生产量,从省区到基层政府,都有一个明显的不断加码过程,不同的只是程度的差异。在“大跃进”的过程中,由官员竞争驱动的层层加码过程使得中央确定的粮食收购和钢铁产量指标变得越来越脱离实际,导致一个初衷良好的经济赶超尝试最终走向失败,酿成了巨大的经济灾难。

近年来从中央到地方围绕着“节能减排”展开的博弈和互动能够让我们清晰地看到“层层加码”在其中的作用和影响。中国政府在“十一五”规划制定时承诺单位GDP能耗下降20%,但“十一五”前四年累计单位GDP能耗只下降了14.38%,2010年上半年单位能耗不降反升,使得2010年下半年的节能任务极为艰巨。在这个背景下,国家工信部向各省市下达了淘汰落后产能的指标。在分解和下达指标的过程中,一些节能任务艰巨的省份(如河北、山东、浙江、河南、山西)纷纷主动加压,承诺实现比中央分配更高的指标。而在省向市、市向县层层分解节能指标时,一些市县政府也“自我加压”,如浙江的宁波市和绍兴县。但另一方面,地方政府的“自我加压”带来了两个问题,一是中央对省级政府习惯性多承诺不放心,不得不经过几轮协商达成一个可行的目标分解量,以免导致全国性计划落空;二是层层分解和层层加码到了基层政府,节能减排就演变成了“一刀切”式的拉闸限电。2010年7月起,浙江、江苏、山西、河北、海南等地都对高耗能企业采取强制性限电政策,以保证当地节能减排指标完成,在县区一级,情况则更为严重,拉闸限电波及普通居民的日常生活,甚至取暖过冬(周黎安等,2015a)。

地方政府的层层加码也经常使得国家层面制定的一些规划和计划失去长期性指导意义。这里仅以中国清洁能源的发展规划为例加以说明。据国家能源局2010年的规划,到2020年,风电的装机容量将达1亿千瓦以上,核电的装机容量则达7000—8000万千瓦。而据媒体报道,地方政府上报到中央的2020年的风电总装机已经超过2.5亿千瓦,而按照落地规划计算的核电总装机容量已达到1.6亿千瓦。中国地方政府发展清洁能源的热情,使刚刚制定完成的国家能源规划不得不面临调整。

## 6.2 官员中期排名与地区增长

现有文献关于政治锦标赛的实证研究均假定中国地方官员的政治锦标赛是静态的,即上级对官员进行的绩效考核是一次性的。我最近的一项合作研究从动态锦标赛的新角度考察中国地方官员的激励和行为(乔坤元等,2014)。官员竞争的动态特性主要表现在以下两个方面。第一,官员每年都要接受一次绩效考核,虽然一般来说只有任期内整体的经济绩效才会影响上级对官员的最终评价,但是每一年的绩效表现仍然是重要的,给上级传递关于官员的有用信息。而且,官员的绩效在整个任期之内都会与其他官员进行比赛。这表明官场竞争跨越多个阶段而不仅仅是一次性的,官员为晋升而展开的博弈是多阶段博弈。第二,在晋升竞争的各个阶段,官员们可以知晓自己在上一阶段的绝对和相对绩效排名,比如官方定期公布经济发展有关的统计数据,这会对他们后续的竞争策略、促进经济增长的努力程度以及最终的结果产生重要的影响。根据Goltsman和Mukherjee(2011)的总结,动态锦标赛与静态锦标赛最大的区别在于,博弈出现在不同的阶段,并且在各个阶段之间会有中期的信息披露(interim information disclosure),即各个选手可以知道自己的中期排名(即上一期的排名),中期排名会对博弈参与人后续的激励和行为产生影响。因此,从以上两个方面来看,中国地方官员的政治锦标赛应该具有动态的性质。

我们的研究使用地市级书记和市长1999—2011年的面板数据,从动态锦标赛的角度考察了省内地市GDP增长的中期排名对地市当期GDP增长的影响。我们发现,中期排名越高的官员,当期绩效越好。给定其他条件不变,中期排名每上升1个标准差(0.287),那么当期的GDP增长率会增加0.45个百分点,与样本期间12%左右的平均经济增长率相比,这一影响是不可忽视的。

由于地级市官员流动频繁,平均任期只有两至三年,我们区分了前任官员和现任官员的中期排名的不同影响,得到了两个有趣的发现。首先,当前任的中期排名靠前的时候,中期排名对当期官员会产生正向激励,使之提高当期的经济增长率,反之就降低当期经济增长率。给定其他条件不变,前任中期排名每上升一个标准差(在排名数值上其实是减少一个标准差),当期GDP增长率会上升0.53个百分点。其次,如果是现任官员的中期排名靠前,相比前任排名的影响,他(她)所在地市当期GDP增长率会有所下降。具体来说,当官员自己上一期排名每上升一个标准差,相比前任排名带来的增长率的提高,当期GDP增长率的增速下降0.12个百分点。

上述的这些实证发现可以从中国地方官员的动态锦标赛的角度给出解释。第一个发现可以解释为如下情况:如果是前任官员的中期排名,上一年的经济绩效排名越高,那么现任官员面临的绩效压力就越大,他(她)不愿意被前任比下去,因而必须更加努力,提高当期的经济增长率。这个实证结果进一步验证了相对绩效评估所产生的强大激励效应:当前任官员的绩效作为现任官员能力或绩效的比较基准时,现任官员的努力程度会随之提高。周黎安等(2005)和Wu等(2013)在省级和地级市官员的层面上都提供了关于前任官员作为现任官员比较基准的经验证据,本研究得出的结果和这些文献里的发现是相互映衬和相互支持的。第二个实证发现可以解释为,如果前一年的政绩是现任官员自己的,中期排名靠前使他们促增长的努力程度相对有所下降,或者更多地关注其他的一些施政目标(如环境和民生问题),从而使当期的经济绩效相对逊色一些。反过来,如果官员自己上一年的排名靠后,相比前任排名靠后,则会面临更大的压力,可能会不惜牺牲社会经济的一些其他方面来换取更快的增长率。

虽然我们从动态政治锦标赛的角度解释了官员中期排名与当前经济绩效的关系,但是人们可能对这些解释仍然存有疑问,因为这些解释更多是猜测性质,毕竟我们没有提供官员激励在其中起作用的直接证据。为了验证官员晋升激励解释的有效性,我们另辟蹊径,考察官员临界年龄的变化对中期排名效应的影响。在中国的现行人事制度下,地方官员达到一定年龄就要强制退休。按国家规定,地厅级官员正式退休的年龄是60岁。在到达正式退休年龄之前,官员还极有可能退居二线(比如进入人大和政协)。Yu等(2016)、纪志宏等(2014)的研究表明,地级市的书记和市长一旦超过54—55岁,晋升几率大幅度下降,退居二线的几率大幅度上升。这些研究还发现,市级主要官员一旦达到或超过某些临界年龄(如54岁),其相关行为(如对银行贷款和社会固定投资增长率的干预)将发生显著的变化。利用中国这个特殊的制度背景,我们考察了官员临界年龄的变化如何影响中期排名的效应。给定我们设置了从52岁一直到57岁的各个临界年龄,实证分析显示地市书记在54岁之后中期排名的影响不再显著。如上所述,54岁被证明是地级市书记退居二线的关键年龄,因此中期排名的影响在这个关键性年龄之后明显减弱说明,我们发现的中期排名对当期绩效的影响和锦标赛之下的官员激励有着密切关系。

对于我们实证分析得到的结果,即中期排名高的地市下一年GDP增长率更高,一种可能的解释是,各个省内地市之间的经济增长率出现了不断发散的情况,即上一期增长快的地区下一期增长也快,而与官员激励无关。当然,这种替代性解释无法回答为什么前任和现任的中期排名会造成不同的下一年GDP增长率。关于省内地市经济增长是否存在发散的趋势,我们可以借助增长收敛(growth convergence)文献的做法,用当期GDP增长率对上一期GDP增长率进行回归,考察上一期GDP增长率对当期增长的影响。利用这种方法,我们对每个省市自治区(以一省之内的地级市为观察单位)都分别做了回归分析,发现绝大多数省市自治区内部不存在增长率发散的现象,我们看到的反而是增长率收敛的趋势,即上一期增长快的地区下一期增长率趋于下降。因此,中期排名影响当期绩效的结果并不是由于各个省内经济增长率出现了发散的现象所致。[^4]

GDP增长的中期排名如果确实如上所显示的那样对官员激励产生重要影响,那么我们将会观察到地方官员在中期排名压力之下而采取相应的策略和措施,这些策略措施有可能短期内提高经济增长,但在长期内对地区的发展不利。在这方面,最典型的情况是,一些地方官员迫于排名的压力,为了促进其任期内的GDP绩效,不惜采取各种经济手段招商引资,如提供廉价的土地、优惠的财税以及良好的基础设施和产业配套,吸引各类企业进入辖区。在有些情况下,这些被吸引进来的企业有可能来自高污染行业,对当地环境造成破坏。从经济学角度看,这种以污染换取增长的情况属于典型的“多任务下的激励扭曲”(Holmstrom and Milgrom,1991;周黎安,2007)。

为了考察上述影响机制,我们试图看中期排名如何影响地市新企业的进入,尤其是“污染行业”新企业的进入数量。从国家统计局的工业企业调查数据可以获得一个地市1999—2007年每年加总的制造业新进入的企业数量。《中国统计年鉴》给出了各个行业排放的废水、废气和废渣的数量,我们分别将这三种废弃物排放量前1/3的行业定义为“废水排量大的行业”、“废气排量大的行业”和“废渣排量大的行业”,然后利用国家统计局工业企业调查数据分别计算当年该地市中这三种行业中制造业企业的进入数量的总和。实证分析的结果表明,首先,前任中期排名越高,下一期会吸引更多的新企业,而现任中期排名越高,下一年的新企业进入数量会相对少一点。这说明官员在中期排名的压力之下,尤其当前任的中期排名高的时候,可能通过吸引新企业来刺激经济,这与我们前面发现的结果相一致。其次,当前任的中期排名越高,现任官员会吸引更多的高污染行业的新企业到当地经营以换取经济增长,而如果现任官员的中期绩效更高,相对前任排名高来说,他们会对高污染行业的新企业进入施加一定的限制。这两个经验发现为中期排名影响官员激励的可能机制提供了重要的经验证据,尤其是发现官员在政绩排名的压力之下会通过牺牲环境保护来促进经济增长。

由于地方官员的竞争发生在多个阶段并且他们可以知晓自己的中期排名,因此根据Goltsman和Mukherjee(2011)的定义,用“动态锦标赛”来刻画中国地方官员的竞争应该更加合理,这为我们研究政治锦标赛开拓了新的视角和思路。这项研究将动态锦标赛理论应用于中国特定的官场竞争的环境,它与西方地区间的标尺竞争有很大差异,既从一个侧面验证了关于经济绩效与地方官员晋升的内在关系及其对官员激励的影响,又让我们更清楚地看到官场竞争的结局如何影响到地区竞争和经济增长,从而对中国地方官员激励与行为有了更深入的理解。该研究对于下一步如何改革和完善官员考核机制也提供了一定的启示。首先,我们确实发现,围绕GDP增长率的排名和竞争对地方官员产生了强大的激励效应。其次,中期排名可能会进一步扭曲官员的激励从而对经济社会产生负面影响,比如他们可能会牺牲环境保护来换取经济增长率的提高。这反映了官员政治锦标赛中的两个问题。第一,在“以GDP论英雄”的考核体系下,官员可能会以牺牲环境为代价来换取经济的增长,这种以牺牲环境为代价的粗放的增长模式难以长久维持。第二,官员可能更加注重短期内能刺激经济的手段,如吸引制造业新企业等,但是要保持中国经济的可持续增长还在于提高全要素生产率和改善资源的配置效率。这些问题需要在未来的官员绩效考核制度的改革中加以注意,以便设计出更加科学有效的考核机制,从而影响和改变地方官员的激励和行为。所以,从这个意义上说,中国经济增长模式的转型的一个关键性条件在于地方官员激励方式的转型。

## 6.3 政治商业周期

改革开放以来,中国经济的周期性波动与党代会和人代会召开的周期之间存在密切的关联,这一现象的存在引起了国内学者对于中国政治商业周期问题的关注和探讨。近年来已有不少文献从不同角度验证中国经济波动周期与党代会召开周期之间的重要关联(刘瑞明、白水秀,2007;王贤彬等,2010)。另外一些研究工作试图理解地方官员的激励特征与中国经济增长和波动的直接联系。张军、高远(2007)利用省级水平的数据发现官员任期与经济增长的关系呈现出倒U型的特征。王贤彬、徐现祥(2008)虽然强调两者之间的倒U型关系因官员的来源不同而呈现不同的结果,但总体上仍然验证了这种关系的存在。刘瑞明、白永秀(2007)认为,中国的经济周期本质上是地方官员的“晋升体制周期”和“宏观调控”结合的产物。王贤彬等(2010)的实证研究表明,我国改革开放之后出现了政治投资周期,地方官员更替倾向于推高全国总体的投资增长率,这种现象在20世纪90年代以来表现得更加明显。

从理论上说,中国经济波动与政治周期的高度吻合也可能只是一种巧合,或者由某种与政治或官员激励无关的因素驱动的结果,因而并不必然支持中国政治商业周期的假说。换句话说,从宏观层面的经济波动周期与政治周期的相关性引出政治商业周期假说需要寻找微观层面上的可靠证据。在这方面,上面提及的一些文献只提供了有限的经验证据。比如已有的发现表明,官员所在地区的经济增长与官员的任期呈现倒U型关系,这说明了官员激励与地区增长之间存在一定的联系,但是经济增长仍然由许多因素综合决定,它与官员的激励与行为之间的联系还是间接和模糊的。另一方面,经济增长和波动更多受到投资和信贷投放的驱动。如果我们考察投资和信贷投放的波动情况,可以发现,1978—2008年间,中国的全社会固定资产投资增长率在-7.2%和61.8%之间波动,信贷投放增长率在6.01%和33.09%之间波动,远远大于经济增长率的波动情况。因此,考察投资和信贷投放的波动是理解增长波动的重要视角。而中国作为政府主导型经济形态,一个地区的投资规模与信贷投放明显受到地方政府经济发展规划的影响,与地方主要官员的激励和行为的联系比经济增长要直接和紧密得多。

我和合作者从事的一项研究试图建立地方官员的激励结构与地区投资和信贷投放变动之间的关联(谭之博等,2015)。我们运用1978—2008年间省级面板数据,探讨省级主要官员的任期与固定资产投资和信贷投放的关系。我们发现,一个省份的固定资产投资与信贷投放都与该省主要官员(省委书记与省长)的任期呈现倒U形的关系,转折点为三至四年左右,略短于官员的平均任期。这种关系在官员退休制度推行后和分税制改革之后表现得更加明显。分税制改革后,官员任期的转折点较改革之前与整个样本的结果都有所提前,官员行为更加短视。与省长相比,省委书记任期内的倒U型关系表现得更加显著,且其转折点更为靠后。

由于固定资产投资与信贷投放是拉动经济增长的重要引擎,我们的经验证据有助于理解为什么经济增长与官员任期呈现倒U形关系。我们还发现,党代会的年份往往是官员换届的高峰,考虑到固定资产投资与信贷投放对于经济增长的滞后效应以及它们大致在官员任期的第三或第四年达到高峰,我们的实证结果有助于理解为什么在党代会召开的年份经济增长率往往处于峰值。

官员们面临任期限制下的最优化行为本质上是一种短视行为,正是预期到自身的努力可能会给继任的官员带来正的外溢效应,官员们在任期的后半段会减少固定资产投资与信贷投放的力度。该研究的实证发现有助于说明,地方官员的晋升激励和党代会前后的集中换届应该是导致中国经济波动与政治周期吻合的一个重要原因,为中国政治商业周期假说提供了较为直接的微观基础。

我的另一项合作研究考察了地方党代会周期与地区资源错配程度之间的关系(周黎安等,2013)。本研究的思路是利用省级党代会作为重要事件,考察资源错配程度是否与党代会的政治周期有关。关于资源错配的度量,本研究沿用Hsieh和Klenow(2009)开创的方法计算各个地级市制造业细分行业的资源错配程度。[^5] 之所以考察党代会的周期是由于党代会是市委书记和市长集中换届的时间,并且是可以预期的事件,因此官员在以经济增长为考核标准的体制下,有很强的激励对地区经济进行适时干预,以便在集中换届之前拿出好的绩效。如上所述,已有不少文献发现地方的经济波动与党代会周期存在显著的关系,另一些研究也发现地区的经济和投资波动与地方官员的任期等个人特质有着重要关联。然而,地方官员单纯追求GDP增长本身,尤其是只关心任期内出的短期GDP增长,可能会扭曲地区产业配置的效率。

这项研究采用的数据来自1998—2007年中国工业企业数据和地级层面的官员数据。计量分析发现,在控制有关因素的情况下,在省级党代会召开的当年和后两年,地级行政区的资源错配程度显著较高,在接下来的两年有所降低。这说明资源错配与党代会周期的年份分布存在系统的相关性。如何解释这些统计结果呢?我们认为,首先,资源错配与党代会周期之间的显著关联的一个背景性因素是地方官员的激励对中国制造业的资源配置状态可能产生的重要影响。每5年一届的党代会在中国是非常重要的事件,通常党代会当年是地方官员的换届高峰,例如2001—2002年党代会期间有41.6%的市委书记被替换,因此党代会意味着有一大批官员履新、晋升和离任,并且该事件是可以被预期的,因而可能会进入地方官员的行为预期。现有文献和大量的经验观察发现,地方官员有很强的政治激励致力于辖区的招商引资和经济发展,因此有理由相信,在中国现行的政治锦标赛体制之下,地方官员会为晋升而“努力工作”,拉动任期内的经济增长,从而可以在官场竞争中获得更多优势。由于官员通常只关注任期内的短期增长,利用自身的行政手段和个人影响上项目、扩大投资,干预地区经济运行,这有可能带动了经济总量的增长,但极可能是以经济效率和长期增长为代价实现的。官员的晋升激励和任期内绩效设计加上可预期的党代会周期是导致资源错配与政治周期产生内在关联的关键性因素。

其次,如上所揭示的资源错配与党代会周期的年份顺序的关系也可以由地方官员所面临的激励性质来解释。假定一个地方主要官员施政的个人目标是政治晋升,而晋升要求地方官员在任期内必须显示足够好的经济增长绩效(这正是大家普遍谈论的“GDP崇拜”的具体含义)。一个理性的官员最优的反应将是在任期开始不断增加投资,或推出有助于投资增加的经济政策,以保证扩大投资的增长效应在任期内充分体现出来。但是当接近任期的后期时,地方官员的投资冲动将会下降,因为此时投资带动的增长成绩将可能不属于自己,而会溢出给继任者。换句话说,地方官员在任期初期干预经济的动机最为强烈,然后到了一定年数之后逐渐递减。这在一定程度上解释了资源错配程度在党代会当年最高,之后两年逐渐下降,到了后面两年系数变得不再显著的经验发现。关于资源错配在党代会周期前两年表现最为明显还有一个解释,那就是前任官员经济干预的消极后果逐渐呈现以及接任官员放弃前任官员支持的项目。我们经常看到的现象是,一旦现任官员晋升或卸任,接任官员走马上任,前任官员扩大投资的各种消极后果逐渐凸显(如产量过剩);而后任官员为突出自己的政绩,对于前任官员主推的项目或产业往往缺乏兴趣,更喜欢另起炉灶,导致前期上马项目后续投资不足,演变成众多“烂尾工程”,这就是人们经常抱怨的“人走政息”。这些都会导致在党代会集中换届之后资源错配程度的增加。

上述从官员激励的角度解析制造业资源错配与党代会周期的统计关联更多的是猜测,为了增强这种解释的说服力,我们还需要提供更加细致的证据。我们沿着上述官员激励和经济干预解释的思路和逻辑,提出了三个可验证的理论假说,以进一步验证官员激励和干预动机与资源错配之间的内在联系。

我们提出的第一个假说是,国有企业比重较大的行业因为更易受到官员激励和干预的影响,这些行业的资源错配程度与党代会周期的关系应该比民营企业比重高的行业更为明显。由于地方政府对国有企业,尤其是国有控股企业,拥有较强的控制权(控股权、人事权等)和影响力,其生产经营和投资扩张行为更容易受到地方官员的激励和行为的影响。因此,资源错配与党代会周期的关系如果反映了官员晋升激励这个核心渠道的作用,那么它就应该在国有企业密集的行业表现得更为明显。我们将制造业两位数行业按照国有企业所占比例的高低分为两组,然后分别考察资源错配程度与党代会周期的关系。实证分析结果显示,在国有企业密集的行业,资源错配与党代会的周期不仅呈现正向相关关系,统计上高度显著,而且系数的绝对值也更大。而在民营企业相对密集的行业,虽然党代会周期的系数都是负的,但只有党代会当年显著,其他年份要么不显著,要么只是在边际上显著,系数的绝对值也明显低于国有企业密集行业的样本。这些结果与我们的理论预测非常一致,因而为我们的官员激励解释提供了有力的证据。

我们提出的第二个假说是,资源错配与党代会周期的关系应该在产业关联度大的行业表现得更为明显。这个假说的逻辑是,作为理性的决策者,为了追求经济干预的最大化的增长效应,地方官员会更倾向于影响那些产业关联度大的“重要行业”,通过产业间的关联效应,最大限度带动地区经济增长。因此,在产业关联度大的行业应该更能反映官员干预经济的动机和影响,我们预期在关联度高的行业,资源错配的党代会周期效应应该更为明显。根据现有文献对产业间关联度的测度方法[^6] ,我们将回归样本分为关联度高和关联度低的两组,分别做回归。结果显示,如我们所预期的那样,在关联度高的行业,党代会周期前三年的系数均为负,在统计上高度显著,资源错配的效应也大。相比之下,在关联度低的行业,党代会周期的效应比关联度高的行业小,而且多数年份显著性低或不显著。

我们提出的第三个假说是,资源错配与党代会周期的关系应该在资本密集型行业表现得更为明显。相比于劳动密集型行业,资本密集型行业的投资项目更大,短期内能够带动整个经济增长的效应也更大。地方官员在晋升激励下,为了能够在短期内带来GDP的增长,资本密集型行业是其投资的重要途径,其逻辑与第二个假说类似。为了验证这个假说,我们按照制造业两位数行业的平均资本份额,以50%分位数为界,将所有制造业分为资本密集型行业和劳动密集型行业。实证分析的结果支持了我们的理论推测,资本密集型行业的党代会周期效应确实比较明显,而劳动密集型行业的周期性效应无论在数值上还是统计显著性上都较弱。

上述分析验证了资源错配与党代会周期的关联在国有企业密集度高、产业关联效应度高或者资本密集度高的行业表现更为明显。在政治锦标赛体制下,这些行业属于最可能受到地方官员行政干预和影响的行业,它们的资源错配所呈现的显著的政治周期效应给我们提供了地方官员激励与资源配置效率内在关联的重要证据。这些经验证据说明地方官员的晋升激励虽然有助于促进地区GDP增长,但与此同时也对地区的资源配置效率产生负面影响。

## 6.4 官员年龄与银行信贷

在“锦标赛竞争”压力下,地方官员有很强的动机拉动任期内的经济增长,而投资成为经济增长的重要支撑点。为增加投资,地方政府会通过各种融资渠道进行融资。比如,地方政府会通过出让土地使用权进行融资,或者以政府控制的土地为政府投融资平台公司提供抵押。另一个重要的融资渠道是银行体系,或是对银行施加压力要求其向辖区内的企业放贷,或是通过地方融资平台向银行大量贷款。2008年全球金融危机爆发对中国经济产生了严重的冲击,地方政府为了保增长,通过地方融资平台大量举债,其中银行贷款占据了最大的份额。

信贷市场在中国经济发展及资源配置中扮演着重要地位,银行信贷市场扭曲所造成的资源错配会导致经济效率的极大损失,因此,理解信贷市场的借贷行为与官员激励的关系具有重要的意义。目前国内外学者关于地方官员干预信贷市场的研究还较少。本部分试图根据中国地级市官员和城市商业银行(以下简称“城商行”)的数据探讨两个问题:(1)地方官员是否利用手中的行政控制力,为了仕途晋升而对银行体系施加压力,进而影响银行信贷?(2)目前来看,地方官员通常因任期有限不对债务承担最终责任,如果他们影响了银行信贷,是否会导致银行风险上升?

为了回答这些重要的问题,我和合作者考察了地级市官员临界年龄与城商行贷款之间的统计关系(纪志宏等,2014)。从我们研究的问题看,城商行是一个理想的研究对象。首先,地级市政府通常是城商行的最大股东,拥有控制权。1995年国务院发布的《城市商业银行暂行管理办法》明确规定,城商行股东由当地企业、个体工商户、城市居民和地方财政入股组成,其中地方财政为最大股东,持股比例约为30%,而单个法人股东持股不得超过10%,单个自然人持股不得超过2%。该限制虽已放开,但不少地方政府仍然握有较大股份,或在城商行的信贷决策中发挥关键作用。相比而言,大型国有商业银行和股份制银行虽然市场份额较大,但1998年银行体系改革后,地方政府直接干预其信贷行为的难度增加。其次,样本选择期间,城商行的业务主要局限于所在城市,地方政府更容易受益于信贷扩张的经济效应。最后,即使地方政府不是最大股东,由于地方政府掌握了地方较多的经济资源,城商行与地方政府利益发生冲突时谈判能力较弱。相比而言,大型国有商业银行和股份制银行在全国范围内开展业务,业绩不会受制于某一个地区,与政府博弈中有比较强的谈判能力。

在这项研究中,一个极具挑战性的问题是如何衡量地方官员的晋升激励,对此,我们利用市级主要官员的年龄作为其晋升激励强度的衡量指标。自1982年引入领导干部强制退休规定以来,政府官员年龄成为官员晋升机会的重要影响因素,晋升机会随着年龄增加,接近退休年龄而大幅度降低。在达到正式退休年龄之间,各级地方官员事实上还面临着“退居二线”的年龄,而“退居二线”的年龄因官员级别而有所不同。后面的数据分析显示,地级市主要官员在54岁之后晋升机会有较大幅度下降。对于接近“退休”年龄的官员来讲,由于年龄过大,即使有非常好的经济绩效,晋升的机会也非常小。因此,我们可以合理地假定此时他们的晋升激励也随之大幅下降。而对那些还没有到“退休”年龄、但也不年轻的官员来说,需要抓住最后的机会,用更加优异的经济绩效来证明自己的能力。对他们而言,一旦错过了本次晋升机会,随着年龄增加,晋升的可能性会进一步减少。由此可见,年龄与地方官员的晋升激励将会呈现倒U形的关系。我们预期,当晋升激励较大时,官员有较强的投资冲动,干预银行信贷决策的动机也很强。

基于上面的讨论,我们利用官员年龄衡量其晋升激励强度,考察官员面临不同的晋升压力时,对城商行信贷规模和信贷质量的影响。研究发现,城商行的信贷规模与市级主要官员的年龄呈显著倒U形关系,拐点出现在54岁左右,说明晋升激励的大小可以强有力地解释城商行信贷规模的变动。我们还发现,与官员晋升激励相伴随的信贷扩张,同时会导致贷款质量下降,银行不良贷款率(滞后两年)与官员年龄也显著呈倒U形关系。这说明,城商行信贷规模在市级主要领导54岁左右时(晋升激励较大)达到最大,两年之后,银行的不良贷款率也达到峰值。

由于数据可得性,政府官员出于政治激励干预信贷市场的相关研究在国内外文献中较少。一些国外研究表明,政府官员为了能在选举中获得更多支持,会促使银行扩大信贷或降低贷款利率以刺激就业(Dinc,2005;Khwaja and Mian,2005;Sapienza, 2004;Cole,2009)。国内学者在此方面的研究很少,与我们的研究直接相关的研究是钱先航等(2011),该文研究了地级市官员的晋升压力、任期与城商行信贷的关系。虽然钱先航等(2011)与我们研究的主题有相似之处,但两者之间存在两个重要区别:(1)本研究使用全部城商行的数据,相比而言,钱先航等(2011)可能存在样本选择问题;(2)更关键的区别在于,钱先航等(2011)根据GDP 增长率、财政盈余及失业率相对排名构造晋升压力指标,这些变量与官员的个体特征(如年龄)无关,与官员面临的晋升压力只存在间接关系,因此,两者的关联需要更多的证据支持。我们利用市级官员在54岁之后晋升和离职概率出现大幅度变化这个事实来建立晋升激励强度与银行信贷之间的因果联系,近似“断点”回归设计的识别策略,能更好地解决因果推断问题。

我们的这项研究深入分析了地方官员对微观经济主体的影响机制,为官员激励如何影响地区经济波动乃至全国的宏观经济运行提供了一个重要的微观传导机制,有助于理解中国的“政治经济周期”现象,即宏观经济波动与官员激励特征的关系。

## 6.5 土地财政与“经营城市”

发轫于20世纪80年代中期的中国房地产市场经过十几年的发展逐渐驶入了快车道。1994年全国开始试点福利房“私有化”,即允许国有企业和行政事业单位的职工出钱购买福利房的产权。1998年中国正式废除单位福利分房,大力鼓励商品房市场的发展。中国人民银行也在这一年出台重要规定,允许个人购房向银行分期贷款支付房款,使得限制个人购房的流动性约束大为放松。房地产市场的迅速发展直接带动了地方政府土地出让收入的增长。

土地出让收入最重要的属性是预算外收入,不与中央政府分享,而一个地区不管是房地产市场的发展,还是制造业的发展和城市的繁荣,最终均会体现在土地升值上。持续的土地收入以及未来增长的预期又可以作为抵押品,从金融机构获得贷款。按照1994年的《预算法》地方政府不能直接从银行贷款,但是地方政府借道各种各样的投融资平台公司,以土地收益为抵押,从各种金融机构获得了巨额融资。地方政府逐渐悟出了土地生财之道,打造了一个以土地价值资本化为核心的“赢利模式”。

土地出让的收入和以土地抵押获得的银行贷款,成为城市和其他基础设施投资的主要资金来源。有研究者指出,发达地区政府财政的基本格局是:预算内靠城市扩张带来的产业税收效应,预算外靠土地出让收入,城市扩张主要依托与土地密切相关的建筑业和房地产业的发展,所以发达地区的政府财政本质上就是“土地财政”(刘守英等,2005)。根据这项实地调查研究,绍兴、金华和义乌在2001—2003年间,土地直接税收及由城市扩张带来的间接税收就占地方预算内收入的40%,而土地出让金净收入占到预算外收入的60%左右。几项加总,从土地上产生的相关收入就占到地方财政收入的一半以上。2003—2011年,中国城市土地出让收入占预算内收入的比例平均维持在50%—60%(Fang et al.,2015)。

房地产业不仅为地方政府创造了最重要的土地收益,相关的各种税费也让地方政府获益不少。在分税制下,增值税的75%上缴中央,25%留给地方,制造业所创造的大部分税收将交给中央。相比之下,由城市扩张和土地占用所带来的税收,包括建筑业和房地产业的营业税和所得税及耕地占用税等全部由地方享有,为此地方政府把城市扩张和经营土地变成增加税源最为有效的途径。与土地相关的收费成为地方政府各部门增加收入的重要途径。这些部门的收费大体分为三类:一是土地部门的收费,如耕地开垦费、管理费、房屋拆迁费。二是财政部门的收费,如土地使用费、土地租金。三是其他部门收费,如农业、扶持、水利、交通、邮电、文物、人防、林业等部门。与土地相关的收入很可观,但是高度分散,透明度低,操作不规范。针对房地产业名目繁多的收费情况,建设部曾经做过一项调查,发现各个城市涉及的房地产规费有80—200项不等,其中有合理的收费,但大部分属于乱收费的范畴。国际上一般的情况是,住宅的建设成本中72%是建筑和安装,地价、利润及其他只占28%;而我国住宅建设成本占42%,地价、税费和其他占到58%。中国推行的是土地批租制,根据土地的不同用途,批租的期限从40年至70年不等。以北京为例,北京市出让土地需要购买者支付包括政府土地收益(地价款)和拆迁补偿费在内的总地价款,其中政府土地收益包括向土地管理部门交纳的土地出让金、基础设施配套建设费和资源费。大部分有关的税费,用地者须一次性支付。这为地方政府募集资金提供了巨大的空间。各级地方政府(以市县为主)往往以经营城市为名肆意出让国有土地,竭泽而渔。城市政府乱占耕地,越权批地,少数城市已经到了无地可卖的地步。而出让收益流失严重,滋生各种腐败行为。

如果说从80年代初至90年代中期,地方政府最重要的工作是经营企业,通过扩大企业的产值和利润增加地方的GDP和利税收入,那么,90年代中期以后,地方政府的工作重心已经开始转移,经营城市成为地方政府重置和盘活城市资产、招商引资、创造财政收入、提高城市经济竞争力的重要手段。

“经营城市”不完全是经营土地,虽然这确实是非常重要的一环。地方官员为了提高城市的竞争力和经济发展的潜能,实际上是将地区经济开发、招商引资和土地财政综合在一起,形成了非常有趣的区域经济发展模式。我们认为,“经营城市”的出现是地方官员在政治锦标赛的压力下寻找更加强劲和持久的经济增长点的一种“发明创造”。当然,各地经营城市的模式并不是一样的,而是结合各个地区的历史条件、自然禀赋和比较优势进行创新,形成了各具特色的战略和思路。

“经营城市”这个用语的最早起源,学界比较一致的看法是:1998年9月,中国城市经济学会会长汪道涵在上海召开的纪念十一届三中全会20周年研讨会上提出,今后城市现代化建设要走经营城市的新路,“经营城市”一词自此不胫而走,成为学界、媒体和城市官员经常使用的概念。“经营城市”作为一种新理念,把整个城市资源作为国有资产来经营,围绕着如何打造城市品牌而对城市进行规划、设计、建设和经营,最大限度提升和实现一个城市潜在的经济价值。

在传统上,中国的城市基础设施的建设作为一种公益性质的事业,采取单一的政府财政投入模式,由于国家财政资金有限,政府垄断经营的低效率,城市基础设施建设长期滞后,严重制约了城市经济和社会的发展。政府经营城市的行为可以追溯到1982年深圳最早实行的城市土地有偿使用制度。在改革之前,中国城市的国有土地使用制度是行政划拨,具有无偿、无期限、无流动的特点,改革之后,土地使用制度逐步转向有偿、有期限和有流动。在这个转变过程中,对于城市经营来说,最重要的法律基础是1990年5月19日国务院颁布的两个关于土地开发的文件,一是《中华人民共和国城镇国有土地使用权出让和转让暂行条例》,一是《外商投资开发经营成片土地暂行管理办法》。这两份文件的出台赋予市县地方政府负责土地开发和有偿出让事宜,规定市县享有国有土地使用权的出让权。中国实行土地有偿使用制度改革其实是一次大规模放权。之后,城市土地的各项权力实际上等于界定给了地方政府。省、市、县每级政府都有自己的批地限额。在国土资源分级管理的体制下,土地规划、土地审批、土地出让金收取等权力实际上属于地方政府。

如何经营城市使城市资产增值来提高政府的财政收入和城市的经济活力,各地采取了不同的方式,可谓是“八仙过海、各显神通”。90年代初,青岛与大连在城市建设和工业结构非常类似,经济实力却落后不少。当大连以经营城市名声大振之时,青岛提出了“学大连、赶大连”,每年去大连考察的地方官员不计其数。但是青岛更多是依靠强大的工业基础和产品品牌打造城市品牌,通过创造企业发展的良好环境,扶持企业做大做强,青岛目前拥有青岛啤酒、海尔、双星、海信、澳柯玛五大全国著名品牌。然后以强大的工业基础为后盾作为城市建设的资金来源和城市品牌的基础,形成城市改造、建设与产业发展之间的良性互动。

城市资产包括城市的市政设施、土地等有形资产和附着在这些资产之上的城市形象、品牌、政府政策等无形资产,而土地无疑是城市经营的重中之重。事实上,目前大多数城市经营的核心是经营土地,通过改造城市的硬件(基础设施)和软件环境(招商政策),改进城市的居住、投资、旅游条件,使房价上涨,土地升值,然后采取土地置换和有偿出让土地的方式,增加城市的财政收入。土地转让的收入日益成为地方政府最重要的财政来源。有人甚至把经营城市直接理解为地方政府主导的“拆房子、倒地皮”的活动。然而,经营城市并不都是简单的“拆房子、倒地皮”。同样是经营土地,杭州市创立了一个独具特色的土地使用制度,即土地收购储备出让制度,为杭州城市经济的转型和飞跃发展奠定了坚实的基础(罗宏翔,2004)。中国传统的土地使用和管理制度的特点是,各级政府都程度不同地拥有土地的处置权和收益权,与此同时各级政府管理土地的职能,又分散在许多不同部门,造成国有土地多头管理和多头供应的混乱局面。为了克服土地管理和供应的问题,杭州市于1997年8月成立了土地收购储备管理委员会,由分管副市长任主任,计划、经济、城建、规划、房管、财政、贸易、土地等有关部门参加,负责土地收购、储备、出让的决策和政府各有关部门的协调。土地管理部门之下设立了土地储备中心,具体实施土地收购储备出让的工作。成立土地收购储备管理委员会的中心目的是为了实行统一收购、统一储备、统一供应、净地[^7] 出让、市场运作和资金集中的政策。通过统一收购权和批租权,把过去分散在各级地方政府和多个部门的土地管理权都集中于土地收购储备管理委员会,实现对土地一级市场的垄断经营,唯一行使对国有土地的排他性的所有权。与此同时,又引入招标、拍卖等市场方式出让土地使用权,既实现了土地价值的升值,增加了政府的财政收入,又保证了土地资源的市场配置。对土地补偿费和返回的土地资金,政府委托相应职能部门集中管理,合理使用。杭州市的这种统一收购权和批租权的做法相当于实现了政府部门土地转让的联合收益最大化,避免了政府部门之间的竞争而导致的土地租金流失,同时又保证了土地的统一规划和合理使用。

在城市经营中最成功的例子应该是上海。一直到90年代初,上海市虽然向中央贡献了六分之一的财政收入,但长期以来市政建设的投入严重不足,交通拥挤,市政设施老化,居民居住面积狭小。当1990年中央决定开发浦东的时候,就像以前任何一次设立经济特区一样,只给政策不给钱,中央并没有直接注入多少资金,因此上海需要大量的资金投入改造和建设公共基础设施。可是,这些巨额资金从何而来呢?如果依靠传统的直接财政投入的方式,那将是无法企及的目标。上海采用了城市经营的新思路,即组建一系列的政策性公司,以政府信用作担保,通过这些公司实现筹资的多元化和经营方式的市场化,最终达到为城市建设融资的目的。1992年成立了上海城市建设投资总公司,专门负责城市开发,仅这一家公司在1992年至2004年间就通过各种渠道为上海筹集了1200亿元左右的城建资金,资金来源包括财政投入、内外举债和其他部分,其中内外举债(包括向世界银行、亚洲开发银行等金融机构举债)的资金筹集额占总融资的60%,以银行贷款为主(王云帆,2008,第23页)。城市建设投资总公司的模式不断被复制到其他领域。上海相继成立了多家综合性投资公司,如上海国有资产经营有限公司、上海大盛资产有限公司、上海盛融投资有限公司等,在工业、农业、商业、地产、体育等领域也相继成立了各式各样的投融资公司。然而,这些资金的投向都是耗资大、回报率低的公共设施项目,单靠举债为生的政策性公司如何长期维持呢?上海市的一技高招就是轮流使用这些政策性公司,哪家公司负债率高了,就让它休养生息一段时间,政府补充资本公积金或者划拨一块土地给它开发,然后让其他负债率不高的公司继续投融资。经营土地也是上海城市经营中的重要一环,通过市场化运作,进行土地开发,实现土地增值,到2000年,土地批租就为上海带来了1000多亿元的基础设施投资资金。上海在资本运作方面借鉴国际通行的BOT(即建设、经营、转让)方法,通过出让城市基础设施部分特许经营权的措施,鼓励民间企业、社会资本收购已经建成的城市基础设施,迅速收回资金,同时将已建成的项目以公司方式上市。上海的这一做法在中国许多城市已经成为通用的模式,就是政府首先筹资建设某些公共项目,然后通过出让专营权、股权转让、托管经营、授权经营等多种形式吸引民间资本进入,使之商业化经营,或者有偿让渡特许经营项目许可经营证、城市设施的冠名权和广告权等。

上面介绍的城市经营的例子都是来自中国的发达地区。落后地区如何重置和盘活城市资产、提升城市发展的潜力呢?位于贵州省中南部的都匀市,在贵州九个州市中属于相对落后的地区,在1998年明确提出了所谓的“资本置换”的新概念,被认为开创了中国经济欠发达地区城市经营的新模式,在国内政策界和学术界引起很大的反响。都匀市长期以来像中国西部其他城市一样,因经济落后和财政困难,城市建设投入严重不足,历史欠债太多,道路拥挤,旧城改造任务艰巨,开发区基础设施不足。都匀市委、市政府在财政收入匮乏、银行贷款困难的情况下,通过资本置换的方式,短期内从社会筹集到大量的资金,投入城市扩建改造和开发区基础设施的建设。具体的做法是让渡或拍卖城市公共资源的使用权和经营权,比如出让、转让城镇国有土地使用权和路段广告设置权、拍卖河面经营保洁权和公厕经营保洁权、公共交通经营权以及主要街道人行道售货亭使用权等等。据统计,都匀市1998年共调动市内各种形式的社会资金2.5亿元,其中投入到旧城改造及市政设施建设维护近2亿元,置换取得的各种形态的生产建设资金3600多万元,市财政减少市政设施运转和维护费用100多万元,直接在置换活动中增加的税收近1000万元。而在资本置换之前的1997年都匀市全市财政赤字高达1100万元,是贵州七个州市中唯一有财政赤字的市(张寒松等,2002)。可以看出,所谓的资本置换就是通过各种方式把城市的各种存量资本置换成可供投资的资金,然后再投入到城市建设和经济开发项目,以达到城市资产增值的目的。

城市经营确实改变了中国许多城市的面貌和命运,促进了城市经济的飞跃式发展,也开创了城市建设融资和开发的新体制,但是它同时带来了诸多的问题,受到社会广泛的批评和质疑。首先,城市经营的主体仍然是各级地方政府,地方政府决定城市的规划、设计和经营,虽然其中有市场化的运作,如吸引民间资本进入,但运作主体依然是强势政府。政府成立众多政策性公司直接涉足地产、金融、工业、农业、商业、体育等诸多领域“与民争利”,再次模糊了政府与企业、市场的边界,与政府职能转变(如政企分开、“国退民进”和建立有限政府)和市场化进程是相冲突的。在国外的城市管理当中政府是规划者,企业是经营主体,其次,政府直接主导和介入城市经营过程势必把政府直接管理经济的各种弊端带进来,如产权模糊,软预算约束,行为短期化,权力设租和寻租,官员腐败等等,导致城市经营效率低下,城市的可持续发展的潜力受到破坏,同时也有损社会公平。而且由于司法不健全,政府的行为缺乏监督和制约,在重置城市资产(尤其是土地)时个人和社会的权益无法得到有力的保障。城市经营在不少地区表现为轰轰烈烈的“造城运动”,政府大规模圈地,强行拆迁,导致大量农田被侵占,文物古迹和生态环境遭到毁坏。据国土资源部披露,目前全国80%的违法用地是地方政府行为。2003年上半年,全国各类土地违法行为超过10万起,涉及土地面积39133公顷。中国几乎每次土地管理大的变动都与圈地浪潮和房地产膨胀相关。这直接导致2004年国家决定对土地实行省内垂直管理。

地方政府从经营企业到经营城市,是一个特别值得研究的现象,背后有许多复杂的因素。首先是分税制改革之后许多地方政府陷入财政收入不足的窘况,而城市市政设施建设长期滞后,城市化进程缓慢,制约当地经济发展,这迫使地方政府必须寻找新的财政资金的增长点,而土地和城市其他的公共资源很快被意识到是地方政府手中最重要的经济资源,如果经营得当,这些资源可以转化为可观的财政收入,彻底改变分税制之后财政资源不足的问题。近年来土地财政成为地方政府最重要的财政来源。城市房地产价格迅猛上涨推动地价上涨,土地出让收入增加,房地产价格与土地财政是“荣辱与共”的关系。其次,城市在省区经济中通常都是工业、贸易、金融、科技和旅游中心,对周边地区产生强大的经济辐射,在省区经济发展中扮演举足轻重的角色,因此地方政府之间的经济竞争在相当程度上表现为城市之间的竞争。城市的基础设施和投资环境的状况直接决定了当地企业的经营环境和对外资的吸引力,这是为什么政府经营城市通常与地方政府的招商引资、工业化和城市化战略紧密联系在一起的原因。经营城市变成了许多地方官员塑造城市形象和品牌、提升城市经济综合实力排名的战略性举措。政治政治锦标赛下激烈的地区竞争迫使地方官员不得不去寻找区域经济发展的新资源和新增长点,在这种背景下,“城市经营”的理念一经提出,便风靡全国,城市官员如获至宝,争相学习和借鉴。到现在,即使是中国最落后的县市领导,对于城市经营的技巧,驾驭起来也十分娴熟老练。

从锦标赛竞争、官员激励看中国城市的发展确实让我们更好地理解中国城市化进程的空间特征。我的一项合作研究基于中国1990—2010年城市数据,发现在此期间城市常驻人口增长更快的地区,城市住宅的平均容积率[^8] 反而更低(Wang et al., 2016)。像北京、上海、广州等人口密集且增长迅速的城市,住宅的平均容积率比西安、武汉、石家庄等二三线城市还要低。中国一线城市和我们观察到的国际大都市如东京、纽约、新加坡高楼耸立、鳞次栉比的空间分布形成鲜明对比。针对中国城市发展的这种悖论性现象,该研究从政治经济学的视角在理论和实证上给出了分析。我们假定城市的主政官作为城市和土地规划的重要决策者,为了政治晋升,关注城市的经济增长。为了提高城市的GDP增长,城市领导面临的权衡是将城市向外延扩张,还是集约使用土地向上发展(建高楼)。向外延扩张,将农业用地转化为城市建设用地,可以提高土地出让收入,进而增加城市基础设施投资,提高经济增长[^9] ;但给定中国的土地管理制度,向外扩张需要获得更多的城市用地指标,这必须向上级政府争取。城市向上扩张则意味着旧建筑的拆迁和改造,这需要耗费成本,且增加财政收入的潜力有限,影响城市的基础设施投资和经济增长,但好处是不用向上级争取新的用地指标。模型预测年轻的地方官员因为晋升激励更强而更愿意选择向外扩张的城市发展策略,年老的官员则愿意选择向上扩展的方式。我们的理论分析将城市空间发展的特征与城市官员的晋升激励、年龄特征联系起来。基于2000—2012年的中国200多个城市的数据,我们将上述理论分析诉诸实证检验,发现市委书记事前的晋升概率越高[^10] ,城市的外延边界越远,住宅的容积率越低;而城市的外延扩张相比向上扩展显著带来了更多的土地出让收入,更多的工业用地扩张以及更多的GDP。

Zheng等(2015)基于中国城市经济开发区的数据发现,城市官员利用经济开发区的聚焦和辐射作用,通过精心选择在城市边缘地带建立开发区,一方面创造就业,提高企业效率,促进商业发展,另一方面又拉高开发区周边房价的增长。

这些研究说明,中国城市的官员出于仕途的考虑将城市规划、土地利用与土地财政、工业化和经济增长紧密联系起来,在世界上最大规模的城市化过程中塑造了中国城市发展的独特的空间特征。

经营城市背后的一个关键性驱动因素是土地财政。土地财政非中国独创但是它在推动城市化、工业化和经济发展方面所起的巨大作用在世界范围内也是独一无二的。土地财政因为一直伴随着征地拆迁、房价飙升等社会敏感问题而饱受争议,这里我不想对它的功过是非做出全面评述,而是想从经济学的角度分析土地财政在中国经济发展过程中所扮演的独特角色。

首先,通过市场竞拍形成的土地出让收入是未来使用期限内所有土地净收益的贴现值[^11] ,土地财政通过将未来的预期收益化为当期现金流解决了城市基础设施建设所需的巨额资金问题,扮演了投融资的功能(赵燕青,2013)。城市改造和建设需要巨额的资金投入,而且基础设施的社会收益大,长期收益高,但现金回收慢,许多市政设施(如道路、绿化)不直接产生经济收益,一次性巨额投入和长期低水平的现金回收的矛盾通过土地未来收益的变现和“资本化”得到解决。城市基础设施的兴建和改造极大地发挥了城市经济聚集和辐射的双重功能,推动了中国的城市化和经济高速增长。

传统上城市建设投入主要依靠财政拨款,导致长期投入不足,城市公共设施发展严重滞后,被证明是行不通的。还有一个办法是大规模征税,给定中国现在的分税体制,增加税收的潜力有限。比如房产税的征收就需要建立一整套相关的房产评估和征税体系,国家能力建设非短期可以完成,这是发展中国家普遍面临的问题(Besley and Persson,2011)。从投融资角度看,土地财政是在经济发展的特定阶段上对税收和国家能力的替代。

其次,土地财政为城市政府和官员提供了一种强大的激励机制。按照土地财政将土地未来收益贴现到今天的逻辑,任何增加城市经济增长潜力、收入预期和房价的因素都最终提高现期的土地出让收入,所以地方政府任何改进城市功能和结构、提升经济发展潜力的行为,诸如扩大城市基础设施、改善投资和居住环境,其实都有助于提高当期的土地出让收入,如同上市公司任何增加企业未来收益的决策反馈到资本市场都将增加企业当期的股票价格一样。反过来,一个地区基础设施落后,政商环境差,经济发展乏力,土地出让收入就少,从而可能陷入低水平的恶性循环。另外,土地出让收入属于预算外收入,不与中央政府分享,为地方政府所独享,因而创造它的激励最强。土地财政这种“立竿见影”的收益机制和预算外性质是激励地方政府和官员推动城市化和工业化的重要力量。如我们的上述研究将揭示的那样,土地财政和官员GDP竞争相互补充,相互促进,城市化、工业化和经济增长结合在一起,塑造了中国特有的城市扩张的空间特征。

当然,土地财政不是灵丹妙药,它可能让地方政府过度关注城市的经济功能,而对公共服务的均等化和质量提升投入不足。更重要的是,随着城市用地的日渐紧张,土地财政难以持续,不少地方政府不久将面临无地可卖的局面。所以,地方政府必须寻找新的更稳定的税源和融资方式。在这个背景下,房产税进入了政策制定者考虑的议事日程,虽然它的具体实施困难不少,但最终要成为地方政府所依靠的重要税源。

地方官员热衷于经营城市是因为经营城市又一次把地方官员推到了地区经济发展的前台,使地方官员重新夺取了对于当地经济发展的主动权和主导权。随着国有企业的大规模改制和民营企业的发展壮大,理论上说,地方政府应该逐渐“淡出”市场,“国退民进”,让企业和市场发挥主导性的作用,而地方政府则主要扮演地方性公共产品的提供者的角色。然而,人们所期待的地方政府的职能转变并没有实现,地方政府仍然活跃在区域经济发展的舞台上,长袖善舞,仍然构成地区经济运转中的轴心,与地区经济“一荣俱荣,一损俱损”。从经营国有企业、乡镇企业过渡到经营城市,可以说是地方政府官员在不同经济发展阶段“成功”实现了角色转换和重新定位,从企业的经营者变成了城市的经营者。[^12]

我们进一步需要回答的问题是,我们如何理解地方官员对于抓住经济发展的主动权的强烈动机?为什么地方官员能够实现从经营企业到经营城市的战略转型?为什么我们经常企盼的政府职能转变如此困难?经过30多年的经济改革和市场化进程,地方政府对于地区经济的主导权为什么没有被改变,甚至还越来越大?

地方官员对于当地经济的强势和主导地位一直没有改变,有以下几个主要原因。首先中国改革开放以来的行政性分权向地方政府让渡了许多原先属于中央政府的权力,尤其是对于经济发展来说极为关键的要素控制权,如前所述,几乎所有关键性的生产要素都直接或间接地被掌握在地方政府的手中。这些关键性要素的控制权是地方政府在当地经济中居于主导地位的基础。其次,以经济增长为基础的晋升竞争也迫使地方官员必须时时介入经济发展过程,抓住经济发展的主导权,最大限度推动地区经济增长,甚至不惜以牺牲企业和社会的利益来换取地区GDP增长的目标。[^13] 晋升竞争强化了地方官员参与经济过程、干预市场的动机。再次,地方官员极力控制关键性生产要素,消极应对政府职能的转变,权力寻租也是一个不可忽视的原因。紧密的政企关系和经营城市都给一些地方官员创造了巨大的寻租机会,导致了许多腐败现象的产生。

[[2]](#part11.html_filepos754209) 地方政府的刺激计划可以从下述数字中得到印证:中国4万亿刺激计划中1.7万亿由中央和地方政府提供,而剩余的2.3万亿元主要通过银行融资。该计划需要两年(2009和2010年)完成,也就是说,2009年和2010年每年的银行贷款只需1.15万亿就可完成原先的目标;但是2009年头八个月,银行贷款增加已经超过8万亿,其中4万亿为中长期企业贷款,考虑到这期间私人部门投资乏力,因此可以断定这新增的8万亿贷款绝大部分属于政府的刺激计划的一部分。具体细节参见孙明春(2009)。

# 7 区域经济竞争与合作

长期以来,我国地方政府对地区经济增长和区域经济互动具有至关重要的影响力。因此,地方官员的激励与行为一直备受学术界的关注,成为分析地区经济现象的一个重要的透视点。从国际比较的角度看,中国地方政府在区域经济互动方面所发挥的独特作用应该说是中国经济的特色之一。我们很难想象,在一个成熟的市场经济,地方政府能够如此深入地介入和支配区域经济的分工协作和竞争的方式。

如前所述,中国经济被“官场+市场”双层市场模式所驱动和塑造。在“官场+市场”的互动模式中,官场竞争的逻辑区别于市场竞争的逻辑,前者更接近于一种零和博弈,竞争动机远大于合作动机,而后者更接近于正和博弈,参与人既竞争又合作。当官场与市场紧密结合的时候,这两种不同的竞争逻辑将给中国的区域经济竞争与合作带来何种影响呢?本章就试图从地方官员的激励、尤其是晋升激励的角度去理解中国改革开放以来区域经济的竞争与合作的制度基础。

## 7.1 地方保护主义、重复建设和恶性竞争

在计划体制下地方政府主要听命于中央计划的安排,各种重要的经济管理决策权(如基建投资权、物质调配权)也掌握在中央部委手中,地方政府能够决策和控制的范围非常有限。从70年代初开始,中央强调各省区经济尽量建立一个工业体系完备、相对自给自足的经济。这种情形之下,当然谈不上区域经济的竞争与合作问题。自从80年代以来,随着中央计划管理权力的大量下放,政府间财政包干制的推行,以及政治锦标赛从过去的政治路线标准向强调经济增长的标准的过渡,地方官员的激励和行为发生了根本性的变化。这些变化的一个重要方面就是区域经济竞争日益加强。我国学术界喜欢用“诸侯经济”来概括地方政府主导下的区域经济,如果援用这一说法,可以说中国区域经济的互动关系逐渐从被动的“诸侯割据”阶段到“诸侯争霸”的阶段。而且值得注意的一个现象是,不仅省级区域之间竞争激烈,以经济带和都市圈(如长三角、珠三角、京津唐)为单位的跨省“抱团”竞争近年来也越演越烈。

随着中国经济日趋开放,市场化进程的加快,生产要素的跨区流动日益频繁,企业跨区兼并收购现象也开始变得普遍起来,这些变化都在有效降低中国省区经济的相对封闭的程度,扩大省区之间的生产要素的横向流动。我们也能够观察到一些地区的地方政府在自愿组建区域性的合作机构,试图谋求“双赢”和“多赢”的局面。

然而,地区间的市场封锁和保护问题仍然存在,并没有随着中国经济的市场化的进程自然消失,在一定范围内还表现得非常严重。[^1] 根据一项国际学者的研究结果(Poncet,2003),在1987年至1997年间,中国各省区一方面对国际市场不断开放,省区的对外开放度(即省区的进出口总额占GDP的比例)平均从14%上升到37%,另一方面,对内却不断走向区域封锁,1997年消费者从省内生产者购买的商品额要27倍于从外省生产者购买的商品额,这一数值在1992年和1987年分别为16和12倍。这相当于省际贸易的关税税率从1987年的37%上升到51%。中国省际的贸易壁垒非常接近于主权国家之间的水平,但显然要高于主权国家(比如美国和加拿大)内部的水平。[^2]

地方保护主义在不同时期有不同的表现形式。80年代实行行政性分权和财政包干体制,地方官员晋升也开始注重经济发展绩效,地方逐渐从计划体制下被动接受中央计划的安排到积极主动地谋取本地区的经济利益。这一时期,计划经济仍然占主导,市场力量尚不发达,许多日需品和原材料还是属于短缺商品,地方保护主义主要表现在争夺短缺性的原材料和保护本地市场。当投资需求膨胀和经济过热时,省区政府就利用区域性垄断和封锁手段,阻止本地区短缺性原材料运往外地,以保障本地企业的满负荷运转;当宏观经济紧缩、需求疲软时,又禁止外地商品进入本地市场销售,以保护本地企业。整个80年代爆发了数次区域之间的贸易封锁战和资源争夺战,比如“生猪大战”“羊毛大战”“蚕茧大战”等等。1985年至1986年,由于羊绒和羊毛的价格飞涨,我国北方羊绒区爆发了“羊绒大战”,我国的羊毛主产区内蒙古、吉林、新疆、山西等地无一例外恢复了羊毛的统购统销,在省区交界地区,到处都设立羊毛收购站,大家虎视眈眈,围追堵截,以防羊毛流出本省。1985年仅内蒙古赤峰市在与辽宁、河北交界地区就设立了106个,1986年又增加了70多个(张可云,2001)。1988年作为长期贸易伙伴的粤、湘、赣三省,为了保护各自的经济利益,分别制定了“边界壁垒”政策:湖南省对粮食、蚕茧等12种物质实行禁运;江西省对大米、生猪实行禁运,广东省对食糖、橡胶实行禁运。其他地区也有类似的事件发生(舒庆、周克瑜,2003,第29页)。

90年代以来随着计划体制的瓦解,产品短缺的局面逐渐转变为产品过剩的局面,此时的地方保护主义更多表现为对本地企业和市场的保护,限制外地商品流入。例如1997年辽宁省盖州市强行要求全市45家酒类批发零售企业与当地的龙洋啤酒厂签订协议,专卖该厂的“瑞雪”啤酒,违者吊销营业执照并重罚2万元。几乎在同一时间,河南省固始县则明文规定:“为了保护本地化肥工业生产,禁止任何单位和个人(包括供销社系统)从外地购进碳氨。”违者除没收商品和“非法”所得外,还要予以重处并追究乡、镇主管干部的行政和经济责任。还有些地方利用政府手中监管和其他权力,采用各种综合措施阻挠外地产品在本地销售。例如明文规定,只要是当地企业能生产的产品商业部门不准去外地采购并在本地销售,否则工商管理部门将视作假冒伪劣产品严加查处,或将地区差价全部上缴财政部门,金融部门不准对其发放新贷款,并要压缩收回原有贷款,并强令商家每年必须销售多少比例的本地产品,超额者给予免税奖励,完不成任务者予以惩罚(舒庆、周克瑜,2003,第29页)。为了扶植本地汽车工业的发展,限制可能的竞争,许多地区的地方政府采取了各具特色的保护政策,2000年7月17日的《中国汽车报》对此进行了大幅报道。比如东北某省政府办公厅与1999年4月下放政府文件,规定凡购买本省生产的汽车的省内用户,免收各种购车的附加费和相关费用,优先办理行车执照手续。一些地方政府以提高车辆档次、减少排污为由,禁止某种类型的汽车在当地销售。有些地方政府则在消费者购买、牌照登记、使用收费和限制方面对外地汽车进行歧视(陈东琪等,2002,第126—130页)。

地方保护主义近年来呈现出两个新特点,第一,过去地方保护的重点是本地商品市场不受外地商品的竞争,现在保护的重点逐渐向服务业和生产要素过渡。第二,过去政府通过设置诸多的行政壁垒来限制竞争,现在则更倾向于采取技术和监管壁垒的方式,比如对外地商品提出不同于本地企业的技术要求和检验标准,市场执法的力度也“内外有别”,就像西方发达国家对中国的出口进行限制的方式一样。这两个新特点的出现一方面反映了中国地区之间竞争内涵的变化,对稀缺生产要素的争夺取代了传统的对稀缺商品的竞争。比如地区对人才的竞争越来越激烈,甚至延伸到非熟练劳动力。2004年开始凸显的沿海地区的“民工荒”问题这些年没有缓解,还逐渐波及一些劳动力净输出的内陆省份,这些内陆省份为了保证本省劳动力的供应和工资的稳定,已经开始采取措施对农民工的输出进行限制和保护。另一方面也反映了来自中央的对地方保护主义的打击和限制,使得地方保护的形式逐渐趋于隐蔽。

根据一项基于2003年3月—6月大规模问卷调查的研究(李善同等,2004),中国目前被认为最严重的地方保护主义的形式依次是对劳动力市场方面的干预、阻止外地产品进入的其他非正式的无形限制、工商质检等方面的歧视、对技术方面的干预、价格限制和地方补贴、直接控制外地商品的销售数量、对外地企业原材料投入方面的干预和对投融资方面的干预。而在地方保护最严重的产品和行业方面依次是烟草、酒类、汽车、食品、农产品、医药、电力、化工产品、饮料、农副产品等。

地方保护主义有时还表现在地方政府对本地区企业控制权的保护。90年代中期以后,中央提出对国有经济实施战略性重组,企业跨地区的兼并收购逐渐增多,近年来许多民营企业也加入到企业重组的行列。一些经营绩效好、发展潜力大的企业为了在短时间内迅速扩张,提升技术和资本实力,扩大市场占有率,兼并和收购别的地区的企业是一条捷径。兼并收购本来属于市场行为,只要企业之间能够达成协议,应该是一种改进资源配置效率的双赢结果。然而,在中国,企业跨区的兼并收购经常会触及到辖区内地方官员的经济和政治利益而变得非常敏感和复杂。地方官员宁愿以“拉郎配”的方式强行让本地区的好企业兼并或联合差企业,也不愿意让别的地区的好企业来兼并这些差企业。“拉郎配”其实是想减轻政府的财政负担,通常把好企业也拖垮了,但也比跨地区收购好,因为后者会提高收购企业所在地区的税收和产值。地方官员对本地企业的产权保护严重限制了资源跨地区的合理流动和重新配置,让许多应该被市场淘汰或收购的落后企业得以生存下来。这可以在一定程度上解释中国众多产业(如钢铁、机械、汽车、医药、家电)一方面产能严重过剩,过度竞争,利润率低,另一方面产业集中度严重偏低,无数规模偏小或者效益差的僵尸企业无法破产重组,实现规模经济。

对于地方保护主义和市场分割问题,中央政府一直非常重视,采取了多种措施,出台了许多文件,鼓励地区间加大经济协作,明令禁止地方保护主义行为。早在60年代,中央就鼓励各省区加强经济技术协作,组建经济协作区和托拉斯。1986年4月国务院正式颁布了《关于进一步推动横向经济联合若干问题的决定》,要求国内各地区之间要互相开放,大力促进地区间的横向经济协作。在中央和鼓励和要求下,全国形成了各具规模、各具特色的经济协作区和区域性经济网络,截至1989年,跨省经济协作区有62个之多,比如闽西南、粤东、赣东南经济协作区,闽浙皖赣九方经济区,闽粤赣边区经济技术协作区,西南五省七方经济协调会,陕甘川宁毗邻经济区等等。到了90年代,中央更加强调区域经济合作和一体化。2001年4月21日,国务院颁布了《关于禁止在市场经济活动中实行地区封锁的规定》,明令禁止任何单位或个人违反法律、行政法规和国务院规定,以任何方式阻挠、限制外地产品或工程建设类服务进入本地市场,或者对阻挠、干预外地产品或服务进入本地市场的行为纵容包庇,限制公平竞争。如果出现地区封锁行为,有关部门要依法予以查处。该《规定》的颁布从一个侧面折射出地区市场封锁现象的普遍性和严重性。虽然有中央政府的三令五申,又有市场力量的推动,有些地区的经济合作进展显著,有些地区则只是流于形式,成效不大。从全国范围看,地区市场封锁的问题却仍然存在,屡禁不止。

重复建设问题或产业同构化问题经常在两会的政府工作报告中提及。中央反复强调,宏观调控的一项重要任务就是坚决遏制部分行业和地区盲目投资、低水平重复建设。几乎所有讨论珠三角、长三角、京津冀以及东三省的区域合作问题时著述都会谈及区域之间的产业同构化问题。对于一些热点行业或国家重点工业项目,各个地区竞相进入,一拥而上,经常导致区域之间的过度竞争;从80年代的轻纺热、90年代的“开发区热”,到现在21世纪初以来的“造车大跃进”、“机场建设大战”等,不一而足。

据媒体报道,进入2000年以来,长三角展开新一轮经济发展的角逐,各地上演新一轮的“机场建设大战”。[^3] 有人做过统计,截至2004年初,长三角地区每万平方公里的机场密度为0.8个,超过美国每万平方公里0.6个的水平。与如此高密度的机场布局相对应的是许多机场的资源闲置和大量亏损,但这仍然阻止不了一些地级市加入这场造机场运动的热情。据统计,2004年中国民用航空定期航班通航机场133座(不含香港和澳门),大多数属于亏损状态,真正赢利的不足10座。浙江拥有7个民航机场,除萧山机场营运正常外,其余机场经营状况堪忧。江苏拥有8个可起降大中型民航班机机场,仅在长江三角洲地区就分布了南通兴东、常州奔牛、无锡硕放以及南京禄口4个机场,除禄口机场外,其余普遍亏损。在这种机场运力明显过剩的情况下,苏州等地仍然要上新的机场项目。其中苏州的一位政府官员在列举建机场的几大“利好”因素时特别提到,建机场有利于提高苏州的地位。也许机场数目多少本身不能完全说明重复建设的严重性,但有一点却是值得关注的,那就是,长三角不同地区的机场定位应该反映各地区的发展水平和地理位置的差异,如上海和无锡的机场定位就应该不一样。然而,许多地区在考虑机场发展规划时却都不愿意做“二级机场”,不愿意主动与上海机场进行分工协作。[^4] 有意思的是,珠三角在经济高速发展的过程中也曾出现过这种类似的现象。中小机场大面积亏损问题一直延续到现在。据报道,以2014年下半年至2015年上半年民航机场生产统计数据为依据,国家民航总局拟对全国152个小机场进行补贴,补贴总金额达13.14亿元人民币。截至2014年底,全国大约190多家中小机场,亏损比例高达70%—80%。其实,不仅国家民航总局给予大量补贴,各地地方政府也在贴钱支持。[^5]

长三角的深水港之争也凸显地方官员在区域合作方面的障碍(张颢翰等,2007,第314—317页)。上海作为中国经济、贸易和金融中心,一直苦于没有自己的深水港。由于上海长江口有铜沙问题,难以有深水港,导致长江流域的出口货物绝大部分走道香港,只有一小部分从上海出口。浙江宁波的北仑港属于天然深水良港,然而由于交通不便,经济腹地不足,运力严重过剩。江苏沿江各市为了将市区面积扩大到江,重复建设了的大量的集装箱码头,从江阴到南通60公里岸段,有68个万吨级泊位,平均0.9公里一个,港口利用率严重不足。如果单纯从区位因素考虑,上海应该选择张家港,或太仓港,或者北仑港作为深水港,但是为了选择自己的国际深水港,上海最终选择了大小洋山港,以此作为上海国际航运中心集装箱深水枢纽港。据称选择大小洋山港的弊端之一是台风问题,它是台风的长年登陆口,1843年英国人因为台风问题放弃了洋水港计划;另外它距大陆30公里,需要建成世界上最长的栈桥。大小洋山港计划确定之后,浙江方面担心北仑港从此沦为一个可有可无的辅助港,因此决定兴建杭州湾跨海大桥,一是为了缩短宁波至上海的距离,二是使江苏成为宁波港货物来源的直接腹地,三是启动杭甬运河改造工程之后还可以把长江中上游的货物吸引过来,从而彻底改变北仑港交通不便的瓶颈。浙江省还启动了连接舟山和宁波的“大陆连岛工程”,不仅整合两地资源,还可防止舟山继大小洋港划归上海之后再被上海“蚕食”。面对上海和浙江方面的大动作,苏州市及属下沿江三市会聚太仓,商讨对策,最后做出“三港合一”的重大决策:把张家港、太仓港和常熟港集合起来,共同打造“苏州港”品牌。

港口的重复建设在环渤海经济区也同样存在。天津港自明清以来,一直是北京对外贸易与交往最便利、距离最短、成本最低的港口,也是北方最大的港口。北京利用天津港应该是最经济的,却偏要在唐山建设京唐港。1993年7月,北京市政府与唐山市政府签订合同,投资数十亿元,共同建设京唐港。这个港口需要人工开挖,和北京相距260多公里,比北京至天津的距离多出一倍。而当时的天津港货物吞吐量还远远未达到设计容量。这个耗资巨大的京唐港到了2002年的货物吞吐量还只有1000多万吨,不但北京的多数企业还是选择天津港,甚至唐山的钢铁企业也走天津港。[^6]

在河北省和天津市640公里长的海岸线上,从北到南依次分布这秦皇岛、京唐、天津、黄骅四大港口,天津港属于天津市,而秦皇岛港、京唐港和黄骅港位于河北省。河北省又辟建曹妃甸港,使港口的竞争变得更加激烈,导致货源不足和运力闲置。而且,环渤海经济区的港口愿意与较远地区的港口合作,如不少港口与深圳港都有内贸线路的合作,而不愿与邻近港口合作,形成“远交近攻”的局面(沈东海等,2004,第114页)。

自改革开放以来,我国沿海地区借助其优越的区位和经济优势,通过吸引外资促进当地经济的飞跃发展。这种区域经济致富模式逐渐被大家所认同,因此近年来我国从沿海发达地区到内陆的落后省份上上下下都非常重视招商引资,以此作为区域经济发展的主导战略。各地为争夺外资项目也因此处于激烈竞争之中,甚至达到“恶性竞争”的程度,新华社记者将之概括为“门槛一降再降,成本一减再减,空间一让再让”。[^7] 在许多地方,如上海、江苏、浙江等地纷纷以远远低于成本价的土地价格吸引外商,税收优惠也一再突破国家规定的外资优惠政策的底线。在长三角地区,除了沪宁杭以外,一般成熟的开发区用于基础设施的投入和土地出让金应该在每亩10万元以上,但激烈的竞争已经使得地价普遍从15万元跌到5万元左右。除了上缴给上级政府的部分以外,地方政府放弃了应得的土地出让金,甚至还必须贴上基础设施的投入费用。在税收方面,早已突破两免三减半的企业所得税优惠底线,一些地方为了吸引实力雄厚的台商,甚至承诺给予十免十减半的税收优惠政策。

地方政府为了招商引资而竞相出台各种优惠政策,如降低税率,提供补贴,经常陷入一种过度竞争的境地,这不只是中国才有的现象,在国外也比较普遍。地方政府之间或国家之间利用财政手段为吸引外部资本投资而竞争的情况在经济学上被称为“财政竞争”(fiscal competition)或“税收竞争”(tax competition)。[^8] 导致过度或恶性竞争最根本的原因是“跨地区的外在性”(interregional externalities),即一个地区为了吸引资本进入而降低税率,会导致其他地区因失去资本投资而税基缩小,税收收入减少。这样为了能够成功引进资本投资,各地就像陷入了“囚犯困境”一样,不得不竞相推出优惠政策。当引入的外资对当地企业有正的溢出效应时(如先进的技术和管理经验的外溢),地方政府甚至愿意倒贴。税收竞争理论在一定程度上可以解释为什么我国有些地方会推出“零地价”的招商政策。如果考虑到最基本的“三通一平”的成本以及相关配套基础设施的投入,零地价就意味着是对外商的净补贴。所以地方政府的过度竞争本身可以由财政竞争加以解释,在这一点上,中国的地方政府与国外的地方政府没有太大的区别。

真正值得我们注意的是,在中国,由于地方官员在财税激励之上还有一个更强烈和更基本的晋升激励,给定晋升博弈本身的零和性质,地方官员围绕招商引资的竞争程度将会大大超过财税激励所能允许的范围。所以我们看到,在各地“让利竞赛”的背后是地方政府级级下任务、层层压指标,招商引资被当作地方政府“一把手”工程,一些省市的主要媒体还定期公布下级政府和开发区招商引资的名次。在长三角和珠三角的许多城市活跃着一些来自全国各地的“招商游击队”,在东莞市,每年就有300多个招商团上门招商,有的还将招商办事处直接设在乡镇。更有甚者,一些地方政府还将机关干部的工资与引资数量挂钩,完不出任务指标的将被取消基础工资。[^9] 我们前面还提到,苏北曾经流行这样的做法:年终总结会上,根据地方官员招商引资的绩效的高低安排坐不同类型的板凳,以示奖惩。引资竞争本身并不奇怪,但值得注意的是这种竞争所采取的形式和推进的程度。单单用地方政府财税激励是无法理解这种竞争所达到的“恶性”程度,而必须诉诸地方官员对政绩的强烈追求和对落后于竞争地区的巨大恐惧才能理解。更关键的问题是,各个省区甚至一个省区内各个县市之间为了吸引外资而恶性竞争,使得外商非常轻易地坐收“渔翁之利”,我们却很少看到某种范围内政府间的协调和合作,通过一致对外来获得更有利的谈判地位。在以色列,中央政府就会在多个竞争吸引外资的城市政府间进行协调,让外资定位在多个城市交界的工业园区,工业园区属于多个相关城市政府联合所有,收益共享(Justman et al., 2005, pp.848—861)。在理论上,像以色列这种联合兴办和所有的工业园完全可以在中国很多地区出现,尤其是那些地理相邻、招商引资频繁、经济发达的地区,这样既可以协调工业园区基础设施投资方面的分工合作,也可以统一与外商谈判,避免大家相互恶性竞争的利益流失。而且,在一定意义上,中国的行政体制应该赋予了这种跨区合作的制度基础,比如依靠更高一级政府的行政领导和协调,在很多情况下,这些行政区的地方官员可能还同时是上一级党委的常委成员,这比协调两个政治分权体制下的地方政府似乎要容易一些。但是情况正好相反,地方政府之间的合作往往非常艰难,像以色列那样的招商引资的协作行动在中国还闻所未闻。地方政府之间的协调失败恰好反映了地方官员之间在晋升竞争情况下的合作空间的狭小。

## 7.2 被忽略的角落：行政区交界地区的经济发展问题

我国有相当一部分的地区分布在省区交界地带。据统计,省级行政区陆路交界线共66条,总长度5.2万公里,按边界两侧各15公里计算,总面积约156万多平方公里,占到我国国土面积的六分之一,涉及849个县级行政区。交界地区有山区、平原和河流,涉及2至4个省区不等,如湘赣交界区、晋豫陕交界区和苏鲁豫皖交界区。这些交界地带因处于行政区的边缘地带,长期被人忽视,多数属于经济欠发达地区,中国约有一半的贫困县分布于此。[^10] 从这个意义上说,改革开放以来中国不断拉大的地区差异有一部分事实上表现为省区内部交界地带和非交界地带的贫富悬殊。

为什么中国的贫困地区会如此集中地分布在省区交界地区?当然,交界地带的经济落后与其自然环境和历史条件有一定关联。一些省区交界地带属于山区地形,如乌蒙山区、太行山区和武夷山区,位置偏僻,交通阻隔,远离经济发展中心,长期处于相对封闭和贫困的状态。但是,自然环境本身充其量只能是其中一个方面的原因,因为中国还有很多交界地带不属于山区,属于平原和丘陵地带,或者水流域。即便是山区,通常也蕴藏丰富的可资开发利用的经济资源,如矿产、旅游和生物资源,并不必然和贫困画等号,如果能够联合开发和利用,一定能产生巨大的经济效益。于是,我们需要进一步问,为什么处于交界的相关省区没有有效开发和利用这些丰富的经济资源?

省区交界地带不仅产生了众多贫困人口和未被开发的丰富资源,而且还是中国水流域的污染、缺水和断流问题的集中地带。全国有近50%的河段、90%的城市水域受到不同程度的污染。北方河流有水皆污,南方河流由于污染守着河流无水喝的情形频频发生。海河、淮河、黄河流域由于水污染喝水土流失等原因使得人均水资源占有量只有350—750立方米,属于国际上公认的严重缺水地区(王亚华,2007,第5页)。所有这些大江大河都是跨越多个省区的河流,上下游被不同的省区分割,上下游的省区之间为了各自的经济利益矛盾冲突不断,加上国家水利部门的管理和协调乏力,导致水域污染问题、缺水和断流问题日益严重。近年来引起媒体和学者高度关注的淮河流域和太湖流域的水污染问题和黄河断流问题就是这方面的突出例子。2006年,当时的国家环保总局开始组建环境保护的区域管理机构,在华东、西北、西南、东北、华北6个区域组建了环保督查中心,其监管范围覆盖了全国内地所有的行政区域。然而,环保督查中心只是环保部的直属事业单位,其执法权属于环保部的授权执法,对于全国性的环境污染的违法行为很难行使处罚权,对于对方的环境污染违法行为也只能督查,没有处罚权,具体的执法还需依靠当地的环保主管部门,而后者又是控制在同级地方政府手里。[^11]

Cai,Chen和Gong(2015)利用中国县级数据研究了省交界地带河流的工业污染问题。作者区分了两省交界的县是否有主要河流经过,是否处于河流上游,总共收集了232个县的数据。然而利用1998—2008年中国工业企业调查数据,将这些县的工业企业分为30个工业行业,根据2010年环保部的水污染行业分类标准从30个工业行业中定义了7个污染行业。作者的回归分析发现,工业水污染主要集中于省内河流的下游地区,而且民营企业的排污行为对此的影响要大于国有和外资企业。而第十个五年计划提出2005年的污染指标比2001年降低10%的目标只是进一步使得省内的工业水污染活动向下游地区转移。作者还发现,省内下游地区的环境收费的力度也是明显比上游地区要“仁慈”一些。这说明各交界省之间在处理水污染方面明显采取了“以邻为壑”的政策,这是环境保护政策在省交界地带协调失败的一个经验证据。

行政区交界地区作为经济发展的边缘地带,被人普遍关注的问题就是基础设施的人为落后。以交通为例,交界地区过境交通线路少、质量差、路面标准低、断头路多。1982年交通部在原有公路基础上规划了70条国道公路,总长10.86万公里,其中有32条国道存在断头路,未通里程5020公里,主要分布在跨省区交界处(樊杰等,2001,第93页)。地处江苏丰县、山东单县、安徽砀山县交界处的丰县三省庄,是苏鲁皖三省间的公路交汇点。长期以来,从丰县、单县和砀山县发来的班车,差不多都在距三省庄一公里处调头。被搁置多年的断头路实际上蕴涵着巨大的经济价值。据测算,修通这段断头路约需50万元,但从节约运费、油耗、机械磨损等经济社会效益来看,不用1年就可收回修路投资。该路一旦修通,不仅有利于苏鲁皖三省间的公路交通,而且可以使得丰(县)单(县)路和徐(州)商(丘)路之间约40公里的沿黄河故道果园林带的大批瓜果运往城镇,经济效益非常可观。然而,由于行政协调的困难,最重要的是交界处的政府担心修通公路会让邻近地区受益,这样自己的得益部分就需要大打折扣,使得修路的积极性下降。每一方都做类似的计算,其结果只能是弃而不修。

行政区交界地带的基础设施问题不仅在省区之间发生,在同一省区内部的不同城市之间也同样发生,内在逻辑完全一样。例如,在苏锡常沿江岸线上,张家港曾被江苏省政府指定由苏锡常三家“共同开发”。从地理位置和经济联系上看,张家港与无锡和常州要更紧密,港区离常州和无锡市区只有57公里,无锡、常州的许多货物要从张家港进出;而张家港距离苏州市区103公里,苏州的进出货物主要靠铁路。但是由于张家港在行政区划上属于苏州市,无锡、常州没有积极性投资,而苏州市因为不太依赖张家港,也自然没有积极性投资港口建设,只能要求张家港“以市兴港,以港兴市”,但张家港当时苦于一个县级市,没有足够的财政资源支持。最后无锡市把张家港上游17公里处的江阴港作为开发目标,常州市则在其仅有的20公里长江岸线上寻找了建港条件不甚理想的得胜港作为水上出口。公路建设也遇上类似的“交界”问题。宜兴市隶属于无锡市,但陆地并不邻接,从宜兴到无锡有10多公里的公路需经过常州市武进县南部,这一段公里的等级明显低于宜兴到无锡境内的路面。常州通往张家港的公里在江阴市境内的路面状况也较差,一条路三家管,最后是等于没人管(舒庆、周克瑜,2003,第81页)。

再举一例,从三门峡到潼关段是黄河中游地区航运开发条件最好的一段航道。该河段航道的建设可以方便平陆煤炭经水陆联运供给三门峡西电厂,将平陆的磷矿经水陆运至潼关磷肥厂,同时还有利于开发三门峡库区的水上旅游项目。经济社会价值如此重要的航运开放项目,因为同时涉及河南省、山西省和陕西省,进展缓慢。早在1994年三省的计委就联合批准了该合作项目,1995年4月三门峡市、运城市(原运城地区)和灵宝市、平陆县、三门峡西电厂联合组成领导小组,研究制订了向三门峡西电厂运输平陆煤炭的方案。1996年10月三省计(经)委在三门峡审查通过了《黄河三门峡至潼关段航运开发可行性研究报告》,但是由于各方利益的差异和协调困难,黄河三(门峡)潼(关)段的航运开发一直没有取得突破性的进展。与此形成鲜明对照的是,1999年10月才开始蓄水的黄河小浪底库区,在2000年8月5日就试航成功,截止至2001年5月7日,共运送旅客23.4万人次,占河南水陆客运量的27%。这里主要的区别在于,前者涉及三个省和多层级政府(从中央水利部门到省再到市县)的协调,而后者主要只涉及河南省(安树伟,2004,第232页)。

2005年亚洲开发银行公布了一份研究《河北省经济发展战略研究》,该报告称,环京津地区目前存在大规模的贫困带。[^12] 根据中国的贫困标准,河北省与京津接壤的6个设区市中,32个贫困县的面积达8.3万平方公里,占该地区总面积的63.3%;其中,贫困人口达到272.6万。2001年,河北省的贫困人口发生率接近5%,远高于我国东部沿海地区的1%的水平,但河北省的贫困人口超过一半分布在环京津地区,三分之一分布在环京津24县。专家认为,像河北省这样在距离首都不到100公里的区域内还存在着大面积贫困化地区的现象在世界上也是极为少见的。改革开放初期,环京津地区与京津二市的远郊县基本处于同等发展水平,但20多年后的今天,二者之间形成了巨大的经济落差。2001年,环京津贫困带24县的农民人均纯收入、人均GDP、县均地方财政收入仅分别为京津远郊区县的1/3、1/4和1/10。其次,从反映区域经济发展水平和实力的两项指标看,农民人均纯收入和人均地方财政收入看,环京津贫困带24县与西部地区最贫困的“三西地区”(定西、陇西、西海固)5个县相比,基本处于同一发展水平。

有学者将省级毗邻地区经济开发情况区分为三种类型:第一种类型是弱弱毗邻地区,即落后省份或地区的交界地带,多为中西部省区的毗邻地区。这些地区资源优势、主导产业、生产力发展水平比较接近和相似,单干思想往往比较强,联合开发的愿望比较薄弱,合作程度非常有限。第二种类型是强弱毗邻地区,即落后省份或地区与发达省份或地区的毗邻地区,多分布在我国东部地带和中部地带省区的交界地带。这些地区资源禀赋、主导产业、经济发展阶段都有较大的差异,经济上互补性强,联合开发的愿望比较强烈,合作范围广、程度深。第三种类型是强强毗邻地区,即发达省区的交界地带,多分布于我国的东部地带,由于毗邻各方经济实力雄厚,经济及产业结构较为完整,合作的动力不强,面临激烈的市场竞争和产业结构雷同问题(刘玉亭等,1999)。

我和合作者利用中国县级水平的数据对省交界地带的经济发展问题进行了一项实证研究(周黎安、陶婧,2011)。该数据包含了中国31个省、自治区和直辖市1997—2003年县级面板数据,接近2万个样本观察值,涉及县级层面上的社会经济发展状况和地理环境等指标。根据样本县的地理位置,我们把所在的县(含县级市,下同)分为位于省境内、省界线上、国境线上三种情况。然后,我们又进一步把省界线上的县按照交界省份的多少分为位于两省交界线上、三省交界线上和四省交界线上三种情况。

表7.1对比了省界交界处县级单位和省境内其他县级单位的社会和经济发展状况。省内相对人均GDP是指该县人均GDP与本省人均GDP均值的比值,代表了该县经济发展水平在全省的相对位置。从表7.1可以看出,在平均意义上,位于两省或多省交界地带的县在人均GDP的绝对值和与本省平均水平比较的相对值上均落后于省境内的其他县。省界交界地带的贫困县比例显著高于本省其他地区,它们距离省会城市更远,1990年的文盲率更高,更不可能处于丘陵地区,但属于山区地带的可能性和本省其他地区差别不大。

进一步的回归分析表明,无论是按人均GDP对数还是按省内相对人均GDP衡量一个地区的经济发展水平,省交界县经济发展均落后于省内非交界县。省交界县人均GDP水平比省内其他县域低大约8%。而在保持其他变量不变时,国境线上的县域并不显著比同省其他县域经济发展更处于劣势。此外,我们发现不利的地理位置(离省城的距离)和自然环境确实制约了一个地区的经济发展,教育程度越低,一个地区的经济发展越落后。

如果按照交界省份多少划分边界,回归结果显示,交界的省份越多,边界线上的县域经济发展的绝对水平和相对水平都越低。一个可能的解释是:当交界省份越多,在边界省投资或发展经济的正的溢出效应越有可能发生,这直接导致当地政府发展该交界线的激励不足。

如上所述,我们将省级毗邻地区经济开发情况区分为弱弱、强强和强弱三种类型。在本数据中,因为三省交界和四省交界的样本较少且情况复杂,我们只针对两省交界情况划分了此三种类型。具体的做法是把各省县级人均GDP水平按照全国比较的25%、50%和75%分位数分成四组,50%分位数下处在同一组的省份定位为“弱弱交界型”,50%分位数以上处于同一组的省份定义为“强强交界型”。处于不同组的省份定义为“强弱交界型”。在这三种类型中,强弱交界型占了大多数。

无论是基于财税激励还是基于官员晋升激励的理论,都可以解释省区交界地带的经济落后的情形,所以迄今为止,我们尚不能得出结论说哪一种理论真正可以解释省区交界地带的经济发展问题。周黎安、陶婧(2011)按照两种方法划分了交界线毗邻省份经济发展的“强弱”“强强”“弱弱”三种类型。从回归结果看,三种交界类型相对非交界地区来说,回归系数均为负数,说明交界本身对当地经济发展不利,与前述的结果一致;但是最为不利的情况是强强交界的类型,其次是弱弱交界型,再次是强弱交界型。如果不考虑官员晋升竞争的负面激励,理论上强强交界型应该对交界地区的经济发展最为有利,这就像发达国家之间的贸易应该比发达国家与发展中国家之间的贸易更发达一样。但事实上,我们的实证结果表明,相比而言,处于两个发达省份交界处的地区其经济发展反而是最为落后的。这个逻辑只能从政治锦标赛的角度得到理解,而无法用其他理论来解释,包括“行政区经济”理论也无法解释这个看上去比较奇怪的结果。我们下一节将深入分析这个发现背后的官场竞争逻辑。

关于地方官员的晋升激励如何影响省交界地带的排污行为,Kahn,Li和Zhao(2015)有一项研究提供了非常有趣的实证分析。这个研究利用了一个非常重要的制度背景,即2006年第十一个五年规划明确提出,2010年中国的二氧化硫的排放量比2005年减少10%,而且,这个减排目标与地方官的晋升直接挂钩。如果省区未能完成减排目标,地方领导人可能被免职。前面我们从Cai,Chen和Gong(2016)的研究中看到,“十五”计划虽然也提出2005年的排污量比2001年减少10%,但这个目标没有和地方领导人的晋升直接挂钩,所以我们看到了各交界省“以邻为壑”的排污行为。与“十一五”规划节能减排的政策相配套的是,中央授权河流下游地区的地方政府监督上游地区节能减排的完成情况,这是针对传统上河流交界地带“以邻为壑”行为而专门出台的政策。Kahn,Li和Zhao(2015)利用2004—2010年499个环境监测点的面板数据发现,2005年之后省交界地带的水污染明显下降,说明省内污染源迁移到了远离省交界地带的环境监测点。作者还发现,2005年之后不在中央考核范围之内的其他污染物的排放没有明显的下降趋势。这些实证结果很好地验证了地方官员的晋升激励对省交界地带污染问题的重要影响。同时,这项研究还显示,授权河流下游地区监督上游地区的排污行为有效地制止了传统上交界省之间“以邻为壑”的排污行为,说明设计一个合适的激励机制对于解决省交界地带的环境保护问题是如何的重要。

## 7.3 地方官员的激励与合作：理论及其解释

前面我们描述了中国改革开放以来区域竞争与合作中一些长期存在问题,地方保护主义、重复建设和区域经济政策的恶性竞争,还有行政区交界地带特有的贫困和污染问题。我们如何理解这些区域之间的经济竞争与合作行为呢?如果说区域经济竞争与合作背后一定有地方官员的主导和推动,那我们如何理解这些地方官员行为背后的激励呢?

经济学主流文献关于这些地方保护主义、重复建设和恶性竞争的解释主要是基于市场和经济竞争的逻辑(沈立人、戴园晨,1988;银温泉、才婉如,2001;Young,2001):80年代以来的财政包干体制强化了地方政府的财政和经济激励,各个地区为保护本地的资源、市场和税基而各自为战,为寻求高额利润而过度进入某一行业。财税激励固然是地方政府行为背后非常重要的激励,可是这种解释并不完全令人信服。如果说地方官员的财税激励是地方保护主义存在的根本原因,那么,为什么同样面临税收激励的国家之间却可以通过双边和多边贸易协定达成市场开放和自由贸易,而同在一国之内的各地区却长期以来不能达成类似的协定?

经济学关于“来自交易的收益”(gain from trade)的基本常识告诉我们,自由贸易可以扩大市场范围,提高各贸易地区的专业化水平,促进这些地区的经济发展。因此,更根本的一个问题是,当合作对所有的参与方带来双赢或多赢结果的时候,为什么地方官员在经济上不合作?当然,在历史上,地区之间、尤其是国家之间的贸易战或税收壁垒经常出现,有时还演变得非常激烈,但同时我们也可以看到,国家间关税同盟、双边及多边贸易协定自二战以来越来越普遍,成为促成国际贸易合作的主要力量,当今的世贸组织WTO和它的前身关税总协定所发挥的巨大作用就是一个极好的例子。从这个角度看,我国地区间长期的地方保护主义就变得很难理解了:为什么国家之间可以通过双边和多边贸易协定达成市场开放和自由贸易,而同在一国之内的各地区却一直不能达成类似的协定?国家之间出现贸易纠纷只能诉诸效力有限的国际法或多边协调机制,而中国的地区贸易纠纷可以诉诸中国法律,也可以诉诸强有力的行政协调,那么同处于一个政党系统领导和协调的地方官员为什么不能坐在一起达成一个双边或多边贸易协定?虽然政策界和理论界关于杜绝地方保护主义的呼声自80年代中后期就一直不绝于耳,但迄今为止,地区间关于协商开放地区市场的正式努力仍然是非常有限的。从财税激励出发无法解释这一点,因为同是出于税收和经济发展的考虑,国家之间已达成各种形式、且行之有效的贸易合作协定,为什么中国的地区之间却不能这样做?况且中国的地方官员还同时处于一个行政系统,理论上比国家之间的合作要花费更少的协调和监督成本。

在2004年的全国“两会”上,一位东北的人大代表在谈及振兴大东北过程中出现的“诸侯经济”现象时尖锐地指出: 当市场渴望连接在一起也应该连接在一起的时候,政府官员们却没有坐到一起研究彼此间的协调发展,这种现象不仅在东北存在,在全国也存在。[^13] 为什么市场渴望协调与合作时政府官员却迟迟不愿意坐到一起?这是传统解释所无法回答的。

关于重复建设问题的传统解释也存在一些未解的疑问。关于地区之间重复建设的传统解释是,政府管制导致市场价格严重扭曲,使得某些行业垄断利润高,从而导致地区竞相进入这些行业。在改革初期,国家对价格还有许多控制,传统的价格“剪刀差”还未消除,一些加工行业价高利大,这确实可以解释当时地区发展地方工业时都倾向于集中投资某些加工行业,导致过度竞争的现象。但随着改革的深入,国家放弃了对绝大多数价格的控制,市场进一步完善,价格因素的作用应该逐渐下降。关键在于,这些重复建设的背后都有政府主导或推动的影子,在我国长期存在的一浪接一浪的重复建设“大战”中,各地区带有明显的“相互攀比”和“相互较劲”的色彩,无法简单地用利润或财税动机来解释。如果地方重复投资只为了寻求高额利润和相应的税收利益,那为什么有些地区在注定要亏损的前景下仍然要过度投资?[^14]

关于省区交界地区经济发展面临的特有问题,一些学者指出,中国的经济运行被分割成无数相互隔绝的行政区经济单位,具有“行政区经济”的特征。行政区遵循行政组织的垂直命令原则,上下级行政组织之间的垂直交流可以通畅发生,但行政区之间的横向交流因条块分割而变得非常困难,除非有更高一级的行政组织强有力的协调和监督。中国地区之间的地方保护主义和重复建设,包括交界地区的贫困,被认为是“行政区经济”的一个必然结果(舒庆等,2003)。按照同样的逻辑,交界地带水流域的污染问题也可以理解为多个行政组织之间协调失败、缺乏有效的跨界组织和管理导致的(刘君德,1999)。

我认为,“行政区经济”是一个非常有意义的理论概括,它强调了中国经济运行背后行政力量的存在以及行政割据对经济运行的影响。但是,为什么行政区会扭曲和阻隔资源的合理流动和有效配置,以及行政区的哪些因素阻止了资源的有效配置,为什么政府官员不能像企业家那样去捕抓来自合作的收益?我们经常说政府之间打交道协调成本太高,但是政府间高额的协调成本的背后是什么因素在起作用呢?为什么交界省区经济实力的对比会影响到联合开发的积极性呢?对于这些问题,显然我们需要做出更深入的分析。

从上述的讨论不难看出,我国区域互动中长期存在的产业同构化、地方保护主义和恶性竞争问题不是简单可以用地方政府的财税激励来解释的。这里的核心不是财税动机促使地方政府选择了一系列地方保护、重复建设和恶性竞争的行为,而是给定区域互动中存在如此巨大的合作利益空间,为什么地方官员不能坐下来尽力寻求双赢合作的机会,而总是用竞争代替合作。是什么因素阻碍了一个国家内部、同属于一个政党、同属于一个行政系统的官员不能像主权国家那样达成双赢或多赢的协作?换句话说,为什么一个行政系统内部地方官员之间的协调成本有时还会高于主权国家之间的协调成本?我认为,这是中国区域竞争与合作中最根本的问题,基于财税激励的所有理论无法回答这一问题。而我们观察到的行政区交界地带的贫困和污染问题和地方保护、重复建设和恶性竞争在根本上是同一性质的问题,即跨界行政协调的失败,仍然是缺乏合作的结果。所以我们要追问的是:为什么这些跨界的地方政府之间不去寻求合作共赢的机会?

下面我们试图建立一个地方官员在政治晋升博弈下激励与行为的分析框架,从一个新的理论视角对地方官员经济合作失败的深层原因提供解释。我们认为,地方官员合作困难的根源并不主要在于地方官员的财税激励及他们所处的经济竞争的性质,而是在于嵌入在经济竞争当中的政治晋升博弈的性质。

从激励结构来说,我国地方官员具有双重特征:他们一方面是“经济参与人”,即像任何经济主体一样关注经济利益,20世纪80年代以来的行政性分权和财政包干强化了地方政府的经济动机;地方经济的发展可以带来更多的财税,地方官员能够支配的财源也随之增加,这比“统收统支”的财政体制更能促进地方官员去创造更多的财政收入。

但是更为关键的,这些地方官员同时也是“政治参与人”,他们关注自己的政治晋升和政治收益。各地的官员不仅在经济上为财税和利润而竞争,同时也在“官场”上为晋升而竞争。20世纪80年代初期实施的领导干部选拔和晋升标准的重大改革使地方官员的晋升与地方经济发展绩效挂钩,使得地方官员的个人利益(政治晋升)与区域经济增长与发展紧密相连,从而达到机制设计上的激励相容的效果。地区的GDP增长、财政收入增长、外资的引入直接进入地方官员绩效考核体系,成为地方官员晋升的重要标准。对于地方官员来说,官场竞争比经济竞争更为重要,经济竞争在很多场合实现官场竞争的一个手段。首先,GDP增长、财政收入和吸引外资直接与官员晋升挂钩,地区之间围绕这些指标的竞争本身就是官场竞争的一部分;其次,激烈的官场晋升竞争会进一步强化地方官员的财税激励和对吸引外资的重视,因为地方官员只有自主掌握了足够的经济资源,才能更好地实施其经济增长战略,提高本地区的经济排名。过去大量的研究从市场和经济竞争的逻辑出发强调行政性分权和地方官员的财政激励对区域间经济互动的影响。这种研究角度只注重于我国地方官员的第一种特征,而忽略了地方官员的第二种特征及其影响。

我们在前面讨论过,官场竞争就相当于一个逐级淘汰的政治锦标赛。同一行政级别的地方官员,无论是省、市、县还是乡镇一级,都处于一种政治锦标赛之中。而一个地方官员要晋升到更高的行政级别,就必须在本轮次及以前轮次的竞争中获胜,一轮竞争失利,就意味着失去未来竞争和晋升的机会。在政治晋升博弈中,给定只有有限数目的人可以获得提升,一个人获得提升将直接降低另一人提升的机会,一人所得构成另一人所失,在这个意义上参与人面临的是一个零和博弈。而在正常的经济竞争中,合作使得参与人实现“来自交易的收益”,企业间的市场经济可以是一个正和博弈。“官场”竞争的逻辑将深刻地改变由官员所主导的经济竞争的方式和内容,而这一点正是被以往的研究所忽略的。

周黎安(2004)建立了一个非常简单的模型说明政治晋升博弈下官员的激励与合作倾向。这里我们就简要描述一下模型的基本思想。设想有两个地区A和B,这两个地区的地方行政首脑a和b,处于同一级别的晋升竞争之中。上级政府将根据这两个地区的实际GDP增长率的高低来决定a和b谁最后获得提拔。我们又假定地方官员a和b各可以选择他们的努力水平,比如招商引资的政策力度,或者基础设施的投资规模,这些努力都可以促进当地GDP的增长。由于最后的胜出取决于两个地区相对的GDP增长水平,或者说两个地区经济增长的相对位次(relative ranking)决定了竞争的结果,此时地方官员的竞争策略可以是通过提高自身的努力水平提高本地区的经济增长水平,比如加大政策力度吸引更多的外资进入本地区,刺激本地区的经济增长,也可以是提高自身的努力水平降低竞争地区的经济增长水平,比如从竞争地区那里把外资抢夺过来,或者阻碍竞争地区的产品进入本地区销售,这样既可以提高本地区的增长潜力,又可以同时降低竞争地区的增长水平,最终提高本地区GDP增长的相对位次,提升胜出的概率。

当一个地区地方官员的行为直接影响了另一个地区的经济增长或财税收入,我们就说该地区地方官员的行为具有溢出效应。溢出效应可以是正面的,如修建高速公路既方便了本地区企业,也方便了邻近地区的企业;溢出效应也可以是负面的,如招商引资增加了本地区的外资流入量,也可能同时降低了竞争地区的外资流入量。近年来江苏成为中国吸引外资最多的地区,其中相当一部分的外资(如台资)来自珠江三角洲的流出。在地方官员的行为对邻近地区存有“溢出效应”的场合,政治晋升博弈倾向于促使参与人不仅有激励做有利于本地区经济发展的事情,而且也有同样的激励去做不利于其竞争对手的事情(如阻碍外地的产品进入本地市场);对于那些利己不利人的事情激励最充分,比如从竞争地区抢夺外商来本地投资,禁止竞争地区的产品进入本地区销售,既提升了自己的经济绩效,又降低了竞争对手的经济绩效,可以一举两得。而对于那些即利己又利人的“双赢”合作则激励不足,比如共同开发交界地区的经济资源,加强相邻地区基础设施投资的共同规划和合理布局,这些协作虽然有利于本地区,但因为同时又有利于竞争地区,使得自己的“净收益”不足。如果竞争对手的获益甚至超过自己的得益,那还反而变成了“赔本”的买卖,对自己不利。这就是为什么处于政治锦标赛的政府官员不愿意合作却愿意进行“恶性”竞争的根本原因。

在政治锦标赛中,每个官员都将自己行为的“溢出效应”内在化了,把有利于竞争对手的“溢出效应”当作对自己不利的事情,把不利于竞争对手的事情看作是对自己有利的事情。有趣的是,这与微观经济学教科书所讨论的外在性问题有显著的不同。教科书所讨论的外在性问题出现的根源在于,参与人通常会忽略其行为的“溢出效应”,比如企业排放污染,污染对邻近居民和企业的负面影响通常不进入企业的成本核算,至少企业会低估其污染带来的社会成本,最终使得企业倾向于过度排放污染。这就是标准的外在性问题。如果有某种机制使得企业内在化这些“溢出效应”,比如政府对污染企业征税或者对污染权进行法律界定,向企业发放污染配额,在这种情况之下,企业也会把利他之事当作利己之事,把对别人的损害看作是对自己的损害,而不会反过来,像我们政治锦标赛下的地方官员那样,把对别人的损害看成然是对自己的奖励,对别人的增益看作是对自己的损害。在政治锦标赛下,地方官员的问题是他们太关心本地区的经济政策的溢出效应,而不是忽略它。这种独特的利益计算背后是政治晋升竞争的零和性质。

也许人们会问:难道地方官员就不能像企业家那样找到某种利益补偿机制来避免恶性竞争、实现两个地区的共赢合作?企业家之间有很多方式可以分配合作的收益,比如共享利润,或者得益较大的一方用转移支付的方式来补偿获益小、甚至受损的一方,协调经济利益冲突,或者就直接采用兼并收购的办法,充分实现合作的收益。而对于处于锦标赛博弈的政府官员来说,这些利益分配方式都难以实施。首先,不管地方官员如何合作,政治锦标赛只提拔获胜者,获胜者和落选者之间的利益冲突在正常的政治锦标赛体制中是不可调和的。[^15] 其次,即使两个竞争性的地方政府有可能达成某种转移支付或利益分配的契约安排,但是这种安排因为缺乏法律效力也很难实施。[^16] 再次,考虑到政府官员的很多利益与职位直接挂钩(如权力和行政待遇),合作收益的再分配就变得更加困难了。总之,获得晋升的官员和落选的官员之间很难存在一种可信的利益补偿机制,收入的转移支付几乎是不可能的,在现实生活中我们也观察不到这种利益补偿机制的存在,从而使得竞争者之间的利益冲突变得不可调和,合作的利益无法实现。这可以解释为什么政治家或政府官员比企业家要更难合作。

基于上述讨论,我们现在可以解释中国区域经济互动中一系列的独特现象。如前所述,与纯粹的经济竞争相比(如两个企业之间的竞争),我国地方官员同时处于两种竞争之中,既有为地区的经济产出和税收而竞争,同时又为各自的政治晋升而竞争,而且在相当程度上经济竞争是为官场竞争服务的。这就是我们强调的“官场+市场”的内在逻辑。为简化术语起见,让我们称有地方官员介入的区域竞争为“混合竞争”。在混合竞争中,地方官员不仅需要计算经济收益,而且还要计算晋升博弈中的政治收益,两者的总和才真正构成对他们行为的激励。作为政府官员,政治收益的计算比经济收益的计算更为重要得多。从这个角度出发,在前面提出的模型基础上,我尝试提出以下两个命题(周黎安,2004):

命题1:市场进入的政治参与约束。 在纯经济竞争中,投资的负利润前景足以阻止市场进入行为,但对于混合竞争来说,如果进入后的竞争结果会有利于地方官员的相对位次,那么,投资的负利润前景也不足以阻止市场进入。

命题2:经济合作的政治激励约束。 在纯经济竞争中,合作的正收益可以激发贸易和合作的出现;但对于混合竞争来说,只有当合作的净结果不改变地方官员的相对位次时,合作收益才可能实现,否则合作很难发生。

上述两个命题实际上是从两个角度阐明了同一个道理:对于关心晋升的地方官员来说,政治锦标赛的相对位次是第一位的事情,一切有利于相对位次的都要尽力去做,即使在经济上亏损也值得;一切不利于相对位次的事情都要尽力避免,即使在经济上存在巨大的合作收益。

我们建立的上述模型和两个命题可以系统地解释我国区域经济发展与互动的几个相互关联的现象:第一,地方官员出于晋升的考虑有充分的激励支持本地的企业和发展本地的经济,这解释了自80年代以来地方官员一直有非常强烈的动机推动本地经济的快速增长以及区域经济竞争。第二,处于政治锦标赛博弈中的地方官员不愿意进行区域合作与分工,对于那些双赢的区域合作机会“反应冷淡”;这既有助于解释我国长期存在的地区封锁、地方保护主义和“大而全”的地区发展战略,也可以解释行政区交界地带的贫困和污染问题。第三,地方官员为了提高自己的政绩位次、同时降低其竞争对手的位次,会“不择手段”地进行重复建设和“恶性竞争”,这有助于解释我国自80年代中期以来地区间不断上演的形形色色的经济“大战”,从各种各样的产业大战、开发区建设热到吸引外资的“让利竞赛”。

命题1的一个基本经济含义就是,政治晋升激励的考虑可能使得官员主导型的投资过度进入某个行业或项目,甚至陷入“恶性竞争”。虽然长期投资的利润前景并不乐观,但如果市场进入可以阻止其竞争地区同一行业的业绩上升,即便两败俱伤也是值得的。该推论有助于解释长期以来各地区对许多项目的投资在明显面临亏损的情况下“一哄而上”的现象。沈立人、戴园晨(1990)在描述我国“诸侯经济”的特征时指出:各个地方热衷于不顾条件搞速度攀比,展开“速度大战”;而且,“地方搞攀比,一个动机是为地方谋利益,另一个动机是显示政绩。这也不算错,只是如果把后者凌驾于前者之上,往往会不择手段。”这是80年代的情况。然而,20多年后的今天,问题的性质并未发生根本性改变。我们前面列举的关于长三角围绕着机场和深水港展开的竞争以及环渤海经济区的港口之争的例子很好地说明了地方官员为了争夺经济竞赛的优胜而不惜亏损投资的深层动机。除此之外,这些例子也清楚地表明了地方官员在政治锦标赛下独特的利益计算:地方官员宁愿舍近求远重复建设(如上海不选宁波的北仑港作为深水港,北京不选天津港而到唐山新建京唐港),或者在港口合作方面“远交近攻”,也不愿让邻近的竞争对手获益,削弱自己的相对经济地位。而各个地区在招商引资方面的让利竞争,尤其在发达地区派专人常驻以打探消息,挖别人墙角,更是说明地方官员对于“损人利己”行为的热衷。

命题2说明混合竞争的合作空间比纯粹的经济竞争的合作空间要小得多,好比“刀刃上的增长”一样困难,而且经济实力越是接近的省区地方官员之间越难合作。举一个例子,当振兴东北老工业基地的方案开始具体落实时,东三省都纷纷提出要发展石油化工,都把石油化工列为各自的支柱产业,而且自成体系、大而全地发展。这样一来,在“大东北”振兴战略之下,还有辽宁、吉林和黑龙江三个“小东北”振兴战略,三省互不相通,各自为战。在这种相互较劲和攀比的背后是地方官员那种争当龙头老大和不甘落下风的心理和算计,是政治竞争导致的一种必然反应。单纯的财税动机无法解释地区之间的相互较劲和攀比,如果单纯为了创造更多的税收,地方官员只需要关心自己辖区的税收是多少,而不在乎别的地区税收的高低,不会去比照和模仿竞争性地区。为了避免过度竞争导致的税收流失,一个地区更应该实行差异化战略,寻找和塑造自己的核心竞争力和市场利基。但是,晋升竞争所主导的经济竞争使得地方官员必须时刻关注竞争对手的策略,确保在各式各样的地区竞争中不能处于下风,即使过度竞争也“勇往直前”,绝不退让。

另一个例子涉及京津冀区域合作的问题。90年代初原国家计委曾制定一个环渤海经济圈的发展规划,在规划中,北京的主导产业被确定为高新技术产业和现代服务业,天津被作为重型制造业的中心。但是环渤海经济联合市场(专员)联席会北京从不参加,省会城市沈阳也不参加。北京和天津围绕着谁是环渤海经济区的龙头一直有竞争,天津认为自己应该成为环渤海经济区的制造业中心,北京虽然历史上作为政治文化中心,但一直不愿放弃做经济中心的战略规划,导致北京一度成为在中国特大型城市里仅次于沈阳的重工业城市。有专家认为,就区域合作而言,京津冀长期处于停滞对抗型,京津对抗的结果是“北京吃不了,天津吃不饱”。由于环渤海经济区内北京和天津的定位和协调长期没有解决,该经济区形式上的联合多,而实质上的联合少(沈东海等,2004,第109页)。20世纪80年代,天津倡议成立环渤海地区经济市长联席会,参会的城市已达到二三十个,举行了十多次联席会议。在联席会议中,有距离几百公里之遥的内蒙古满洲里、呼伦贝尔和山西的太原,却没有距渤海仅100多公里的北京市。[^17] 更令人吃惊的事实是,在河北接壤京津的交界地区形成了大规模的贫困带,这与上海对长三角地区经济、广州对珠江三角洲的经济拉动和辐射形成鲜明的对照。京津冀拥有的政策、人才、技术等方面的优势远远大于长三角和珠三角,早在80年代初,北京和天津两地的工业产值在全国所有城市位居第二、第三位,仅次于上海,而河北又是当时国家煤、铁资源的重要基地,但因为区域经济合作的滞后已经使得这个地区的经济发展明显落后于长三角和珠三角。

命题2不仅可以解释我国区域合作的困难,还可以进一步解释不同经济带区域整合程度的差异。为什么长期以来长三角和珠三角区域整合的程度要高于京津地区?一个原因当然是长三角和珠三角市场经济发达,市场力量在推动企业间的合作、生产要素的跨地区流动和集聚,而京津唐地区国有经济比重一直相对较高,来自市场的推动力量小。但这只是问题的一个方面。另一方面,在长三角,上海与邻近的浙江和江苏的经济地位的差距要大于北京和天津之间的差距,而在珠三角,香港和广州的龙头地位是比较明显的。如果一个经济区有明显的“龙头老大”,其他邻近地区就愿意与之合作,接受它带来的辐射作用。如果一个经济区“群龙无首”,那么地方官员推动产业整合和区域合作的激励会相对较小,而相互较劲和争当老大的激励会相对较大。这是为什么经济实力越是接近的地区将越难合作的原因。而发达地区与欠发达地区的区域合作则相对更容易一些。所以,我们虽然强调地方官员经济合作的困难,但绝非主张所有地区的经济合作都不可能,关键在于经济合作是否会影响地方官员之间的相对位次。

更关键的是,珠三角是在广东省的范围内,省政府协调省内相关城市的合作相对容易得多,加上毗邻不存在晋升竞争关系的香港,合作收益显然大于官场竞争的收益。在长三角,上海作为直辖市的政治地位高于浙江和江苏,上海的经济龙头地位不可撼动,这个官场竞争的结构导致江苏和浙江都先后提出要主动接轨上海,这里既有合作(江苏、浙江与上海的合作),也有竞争(江苏与浙江的竞争)。而京津冀的政治格局是,北京和天津均是直辖市,市委书记属于政治局委员,而河北只是普通的省份,省委书记是中央委员,加上北京和天津在经济地位上互不相让,三地的经济合作最为困难。早在80年代初,中央层面就开始着手推动京津唐的区域规划,但因为北京、天津各自为政,进展缓慢。[^18] 进入21世纪之后,“长三角”和“珠三角”发展迅猛,京津冀一体化再次提上议事日程。天津提出“环渤海经济区”概念,强调天津是中心,北京则提出“首都经济圈”,各说各话,2004年国家发改委着手编制《京津冀都市圈区域规划》,试图统筹协调区域内的基础设施、资源环境、产业布局、城镇体系等相关问题。长三角区域的发展规划也同时启动。《京津冀都市圈区域规划》按计划本应被列入“十一五”专项规划,直至“十一五”结束也没有出台,而长三角区域的发展规划早已进入实施阶段。京津冀的区域规划被业内称为“最难编制的区域规划”。据披露,《京津冀都市圈区域规划》编制工作其实早已完成,而且内容非常翔实,但因为各地利益博弈难以平衡,最后没有下文。京津冀一体化的真正突破是2014年2月26日习近平总书记主持召开京津冀三地协同发展座谈会,明确要求京津冀三地领导要打破“一亩三分地”的思维。

我们前面讨论到,地方保护主义还表现在对本地企业的控制权的保护,当企业跨地区进行资产重组时经常会遇到地方政府的干扰。这个问题也可以在我们前面描述的理论框架下得到解释。当A地区的企业去收购B地区的企业的时候,被收购企业所在的地区将失去潜在的税源和产值,而税收和产值对于受到财税和晋升双重激励驱使的地方官员来说都是重要的,尤其当这两个相关地区的地方官员属于竞争性对手的时候,更是如此。如果被兼并收购的企业属于多年亏损企业,一直是政府财政的大包袱,那还好办。如果兼并收购涉及的地区政府属于同一省区上下级关系,也问题不大。但如果被兼并的企业属于本地区的大企业和税收大户,那么地方官员通常会极力加以阻挠。即使税源的损失可以通过地区之间的财政转移支付来解决(这在实际中操作其实也很困难),产值的损失和GDP位次的下降会影响到地方官员的晋升机会,如上所述,这种损失是无法通过转移支付来补充的。另外企业兼并也会更改企业领导人,如果被兼并的企业领导人原来是由地方政府任命,产权更换等于也剥夺了地方政府对企业领导的人事任命权,地方官员潜在的控制权收益将随之失去,这自然会使地方官员很不情愿。

地方政府对本地企业控制权的保护在一定程度上造成了中国几乎任何一个行业(除了国家垄断行业)的集中度都过低,而且以省区为边界形成较为均匀的分布,企业竞争异常激烈。目前在中国,对于一些主导行业,如钢铁、汽车、医药等,省区之间的企业兼并比省内地区之间要困难得多,原因在于省区内部更容易实现行政协调,而省区之间则更为困难。河北省是中国钢铁第一大省,钢铁企业多达180余家,长期以来集中度偏低,企业产品竞争力不强,2008年7月唐钢集团和邯钢集团联合组建成立河北钢铁集团有限公司,新的河北钢铁集团产能超过3000万吨,成为中国国内最大的钢铁集团。河北省计划用十年的时间重组全省钢铁企业。与河北省内部整合钢铁企业几乎进行重组并购还有广东、山东和辽宁。[^19] 然而,我们也看到,对于姗姗来迟的这一轮钢铁企业并购浪潮也主要是在省区内部发生,而跨省区的企业并购尚需时日。

省区交界地带的贫困和污染问题本质上是多个行政区的协调与合作失败的问题,这些问题和我们前面讨论的地方保护主义和重复建设问题有着共同的根源,那就是地方官员激励的特殊性质,比如晋升博弈的零和性质和竞争性官员之间收入转移支付和利益补偿的困难,使得跨区行政协调和合作的成本非常之高。根据前面的命题2,我们可以得到一个非常自然的延伸,解释中国行政区交界地带经济发展和资源保护所面临的特有问题。政治锦标赛和晋升激励使得地方官员对本行政区经济发展的兴趣高于行政区外经济发展的兴趣;不仅如此,政治锦标赛使得地方官员对于有正向溢出效应的行动(如跨界修桥铺路)激励不足,而对于有负向溢出效应的行动(如污染和开采公共资源)则激励过度。这意味着那些处于省区交界地带的经济发展将可能受到交界省区的共同“冷落”,因为这些地区发展的成果最可能溢出到邻近竞争性地区,而对于处于交界地带的公共资源(如水流域和森林资源)的合理利用和保护则激励不足,导致水污染和过度开发问题异常突出。行政区交界地带的联合开发的强度也将取决于毗邻省区经济实力的对比状况。前面我们引用的一项研究认为,强弱毗邻地区联合开发交界资源的动力较强,合作的广度和深度也令人注目,而弱弱、强强毗邻地区的合作意向就相对较弱。[^20] 这种观察和我们的理论其实非常吻合:在政治锦标赛之下,经济实力越接近的地区,合作的净收益(即合作之后对两个地区的经济发展的相对位次的影响)越不确定,地方官员进行合作的动力越弱。强弱毗邻地区愿意合作是因为地方官员之间不用担心经济位次的改变,而且经济发达地区和落后地区很可能不在一个政治竞争的序列,因而大家不用精心计算其中的政治收益。周黎安、陶婧(2011)发现强强交界情形下区域贫困问题最为突出,也提供了这方面的有力证据。

处于省区交界的水流域污染问题日益成为中国经济持续发展的巨大挑战。水资源污染作为一种典型的外在性,在一个完善的市场经济条件下也会存在污染过度的问题,企业倾向于低估或忽略污染给邻近居民和企业的负面影响。中国水污染问题的严重性反映在,除了企业行为方面的外在性之外,还多出了地方政府非合作行为的关键性影响。地方政府的影响主要有三个方面,第一,以GDP增长为基础的政治锦标赛促使地方官员只关心任期内当地的经济增长,忽略经济增长的环境成本和经济的长期增长潜力,为了提高GDP总量和增长率,对严重污染企业采取支持或默许的态度,以各种方式拖延或阻碍环境部门的监测和治理。第二,如果水污染能够影响邻近竞争地区的企业生产,对本地区的地方官员的晋升竞争来说,也许不是一件坏事,而是一件好事,这种“拆台”的动机将进一步让地方官员对本地区企业的排污进行纵容和保护。一些城市在另一个城市的上游搞水污染、空气污染等“以邻为壑”的恶性竞争行为时有发生。[^21] 第三,行政协调存在一个我们反复强调的困难,那就是通过收入的转移支付来让获利者补偿受损者,由于不存在这样一个利益协调的渠道,许多潜在的统一规划、共同治理的空间无法实现。事实上,只要水权或污染权的法律界定是清晰的,一个水权和污染权的交易市场就会内生地出现。在我国浙江就出现了水权交易市场的雏形。这个水权或污染权交易市场的有效运转必须要求不受地方官员的过多干预。

最近中国为了加大对环境污染和能源消耗问题的治理力度,推出了节能减排与干部晋升挂钩的新措施,实行在节能减排方面“一票否决”制。这实际上就相当于在官员晋升的标准方面增加了节能减排这个新指标,导致地方官员必须把污染排放和能源消耗的外部成本“内在化”,甚少必须把发生本地区的环境污染和能源消耗的成本考虑在内。这里虽然没有发生行政管理体制的重大改革,即行政区经济的基本属性没有发生变化,但是官员的晋升标准的改变和污染责任的落实,已经使地方官员的行为发生了一些重要变化。而且,可以预见,随着地方官员对节能减排问题的关注度加大,跨界协调和合作的可能性也会增大,至少他们会更加希望国家成立跨界的行政协调机构解决他们所面临的冲突和矛盾。

由于晋升竞争属于所有科层组织(包括官僚组织)的一个基本特征,因此本节所提出的分析框架具有更为一般的意义。在官僚组织中普遍存在各部门之间相互封闭、相互扯皮的非合作现象,但人们通常将这一类现象笼统地归结为“官僚主义作风”或“官僚病”,而忽略了导致这种现象背后更深层的激励因素。我想强调的就是晋升博弈的性质对各部门或地区官员合作激励的影响。我国经济发展中的地方保护主义和重复建设问题只是其中的一个表现。下面简要讨论一下模型的其他一些应用。

过去十余年我国电子政务发展迅速,但也一直存在着严重的“互联互通”问题,其中一个突出的现象是所谓的“纵强横弱”现象,即一个政府部门内部的信息共享和交换相对容易,而不同部门之间横向的互联互通则相对困难,存在一个个分散的所谓的“信息孤岛”。基于我国21世纪初期政府部门电子政务的研究,张维迎、刘鹤(2004)探讨了我国政府部门之间信息一体化的困难。这个问题即使是当今IT技术高度发达、移动互联、物联网时代仍然存在。需要注意的是,互联互通的主要障碍不在于信息技术,因为在很多情况下是“联而不通”,数据库相接,但信息不能交换和共享,而且,如果纯粹是技术原因,就不应该有“纵强”与“横弱”共存的现象。这说明互联互通背后主要是一个激励问题。在本节模型的框架下,“纵强横弱”现象并不难以理解。首先,给定中央政府“三令五申”强调电子政务的重要性,各部门的电子政务的发展自然会进入到主管的政府官员的政绩当中;其次,为了在电子政务的锦标赛中引人注目,一些有条件的部门会有较强的激励发展本部门的信息化,但电子政务投资绝大部分投在了纵向垂直部门;最后,部门之间的信息共享与合作属于利己又利人的事情,根据我们前面的模型,参与人的激励会很小,而且,“利人”成分越高,主管官员的激励就越小,这就是“横弱”的原因。

晋升竞争不仅仅只局限于政府部门,其激励后果也会反映在M型结构的公司中。M型公司的设计虽然赋予中层经理更多的权力,并便于设计标尺竞争性质的(yardstick competition)激励合同(Maskin,Qian and Xu,2001),但中层经理所处的晋升博弈也会阻碍他们之间的有效合作,这是为什么各个利润中心必须尽可能在技术、产品或者区域上相互独立,以减少晋升博弈的不利后果。因此本节的模型对于理解M型公司的组织和激励设计也会有一定的帮助。

我们上面从政府官员晋升激励的角度研究了政治晋升竞争对政府主导型的区域竞争和合作的影响,在一个内在一致的分析性框架下解析了我国区域经济发展、竞争与互动过程。这个解释也提供了转型经济中国有企业软预算约束现象的另一个制度性根源,即地方官员的政治竞争。[^22] 地方官员依赖于对地方经济尤其是国有企业的影响力,通过恶性的经济竞争达到政治竞争的目的,这正是在改革开放条件下我国国有企业存在软预算约束的一个新的根源。众所周知,科尔奈对国有企业软预算约束的经典的解释是政府对国有企业的“父爱主义”倾向(Kornai,1979),这在计划经济体制下是普遍存在的动机;但在我国经济转型过程中,地方政府官员出于对晋升的政治激励而不惜以地方产业和企业的经济预算为代价参与地区竞争,已不再是简单的“父爱主义”的行动了。

以GDP增长为基础的晋升激励在调动地方官员发展地区经济的积极性方面曾发挥过重要的历史作用,这在经济改革初期、计划体制的束缚还相当严重的时候尤为如此。但随着市场的发育和完善,区域分工与整合的需求日益增加,这种激励机制的消极后果也越来越明显。因此,我们有必要对地方官员的政绩考核制度进行反思。近年来中央政府特别强调淡化GDP指标、建设生态文明概念,正是改革传统政绩考核体系的一种积极举措。

## 7.4 区域“抱团竞争”

近年来区域经济竞争的一个非常引人注目的发展就是以大都市为中心的经济圈(如长三角、珠三角和环渤海经济区)的内部经济一体化进程在加速,而且这些经济圈之间的竞争也在加剧,我把这种经济圈之间的竞争称为区域经济的“抱团竞争”现象。

1983年3月,上海经济区规划办公室正式成立,同年8月建立经济区省(市)长会议制度。90年代初开始,由政府推动的长三角的区域合作协调就进入了快车道。[^23] 1992年召开了长江三角洲的区域合作协调会,参加者为各市协作办的主任;1997年升格为长江三角洲城市经济协调会,15个城市的市长参加。自2001年5月始,由苏浙沪三地的常务副省(市)长建立了经济合作与发展座谈会机制。2004年11月2日在上海召开的长江三角洲城市经济协调会第五次会议,把经济协调会每2年召开1次改为每年召开1次,这被誉为长三角经济合作史上具有里程碑意义的决定。浙江的温州、金华、丽水等市县,安徽的马鞍山、芜湖等市都表示希望加入长三角。2007年12月1日,新上任不久的沪江浙三地领导在上海召开长三角发展研讨会,在确定以上海为长三角区域核心的前提下,构建一个多层次的常效协调机制,长三角一体化被一市两省政府提升到各地发展战略的高度。传统意义上只包含16市的长三角被扩展为包括整个沪江浙的两省一市。长三角在诸多方面开始了一体化区域协调发展,比如统一实施市场准入政策、统一市场执法标准和统一市场法制环境,允许金融机构逐步实现跨行政区综合经营和资金的跨行政区流动,建立“信用长三角”,实现企业和个人征信信息的共享。

我们如何在政治锦标赛的框架下理解区域经济中“抱团竞争”的现象呢?既然是零和博弈,为什么又存在参与人的合作空间呢?我们前面讨论政治锦标赛下的零和博弈更多是假定两个地区的地方行政长官的竞争情况。如果参与人多于两人,形成多人竞争,那么,就有可能产生某些人形成局部联盟、与另外的竞争对手展开竞争的“报团竞争”的情况,即我们通常所说的“远交近攻”战略。比如在沪江浙加强长三角经济一体化,可以增强沪江浙相对于广东省的竞争地位,江苏和浙江不约而同地提出主动接轨上海,也可以看作是两个省份在区域经济竞争中的一个必然选择,因为谁都希望接轨上海、充分利用上海提供的优势资源再上台阶,赶超而不输给对方。而浙江的温州、金华、丽水等市县、安徽的马鞍山、芜湖等市都在积极准备,希望加入长三角,也是希望通过加入长三角,享受经济一体化的巨大收益,提高自己相对于那些不在长三角地区的竞争对手的经济地位。湖南和江西积极加入“泛珠三角”经济圈,山西加入京津唐经济圈都是试图通过“抱团”合作提升自己领先其他不在经济圈内省区的能力。

需要注意的是,第一,不管参与人数量如何增加,只要晋升人数是固定的,那么就不存在所有参与人形成一个大联盟的纯合作结果;也就是说,在晋升博弈的条件下,参与人合作覆盖的范围只能是局部性的,不可能是全局性的。第二,即使有局部联盟的存在,不仅在各个局部联盟之间进行竞争,在一个局部联盟之内的参与人之间,竞争关系仍然存在,联盟成员打败了共同的竞争对手之后还必须面临竞争的局面。同处于一个经济圈,即使存在经济圈内部的经济协作和一体化的安排,各个地方官员仍然有自己的利益计算,内部成员之间竞争不可避免。简言之,合作中有竞争,竞争中有合作,竞争是绝对的,而合作只是相对的。

90年代初,浦东经济开发区的成立给上海经济的腾飞和长三角带来了巨大的机遇。面对这个机遇,各地政府的反应却不尽相同(高汝熹、张建华,2004,第43—44页)。江苏省迅速做出反应,提出“坚决支持、主动服务、接受辐射、促进发展”的应对策略。与江苏省的热情欢迎相比,浙江省政府的反应有些冷淡,其价值观是“大树底下不长草”,担心浙江的“草根”经济被上海连根拔走。1992年,从南京经苏州至上海再经嘉兴和杭州到宁波的高速公路均为各自建设自己的那一段。江苏先建苏州至上海的一段,而后再建南京至苏州的一段,足见其主动接轨上海的意愿;浙江先建杭州至宁波一段,把与上海相连的路段搁置下来,当时上海已经把路修到了松江境内15公里处,而浙江没有把嘉兴与上海的高速公路连接起来,直到1997年才连通松江。

虽然江苏省提出了主动接轨上海的战略,但江苏的不同城市也有各自的算计。苏州建造了连接虹桥机场的公路,利用浦东土地价格较高的劣势,以低廉的价格积极吸引外资,走外向型经济之路,在90年代一举成名。南京作为江苏的省会城市,不想像苏州那样“主动称臣”,试图凭借江苏的经济实力,与上海分庭抗礼,上海打“中华牌”,南京打“江苏牌”。然后到了90年代末,苏州和无锡利用上海的经济辐射迅速崛起,在经济实力上一举超过了南京,迫使南京不得不转变策略,采取了两手抓的策略,既承认上海的核心地位,积极与上海合作,又构筑自己的“1小时都市圈”。

上海作为长三角的龙头老大,也感觉到来自江浙的竞争压力。在引资竞争中,上海和苏州被认为是最强的两个竞争对手。2003年上海市将“降低商务成本试点园区”的规划用地面积从67平方公里扩大到173平方公里,在上海南部成立嘉定、青浦、松江三个工业园区,实施特殊的经济政策,即所谓的“173计划”,被认为是上海设计的一条阻击线,阻止投资项目流入苏州和昆山。针对上海的行动计划,苏州市提出要加大苏州开发区以及昆山、太仓与上海试点园商务成本全方位接轨的力度,包括政策、收费、土地等各项内容,并且打造昆山、太仓、吴江临沪经济板块,将临沪三市建成与上海试点园展开竞争的桥头堡(高汝熹、张建华,第127页)。

# 8 从政企关系到官商关系

我们研究转型中的地方政府,很难绕开地方政府和企业的关系。不论是计划经济时期还是社会主义市场经济时期,中国的地方政府一直就具有某种准公司的性质,这反映在两个方面:首先,地方政府的施政重点与地区经济发展的计划制定和实施有着密切关系,即使在计划经济时期,各种政治运动不断,对于地方政府来说,当地的工农业生产、物质供应和商业也必须组织和保障;其次,在组织形态上,地方政府类似于辖区内的经济决策总部,各式企业如同其分公司或者存在某种联盟或协作关系的外围公司;作为总部的地方政府基于直接的所有权关系,或者间接的控制力和影响力,对各式企业“发号施令”,推动辖区的经济发展。[^1]

当然在不同的历史时期,政府对企业的控制力和影响力所凭借的媒介以及政府对辖区经济的干预方式均有所差异,因而造成政企关系的不同特征和性质。在90年代中期之前,城市地区的政企关系主要是地方政府和国有企业的关系,具有“父爱主义”和预算软约束的特征。90年代中后期以来随着国有企业改制和“抓大放小”,政企关系逐渐演变为地方政府与各类企业、包括民营与外资企业的关系,政企关系的所有权基础发生了根本性变化。我们如何理解这种新的历史条件下地方政府与企业的关系?地方政府对于经济的干预方式、能力和程度是如何变化的?在这一章,我们将描述和分析政企关系的性质及其演变过程。

如果说政府与国有企业更像是政府内部的权威关系,而政府与非国有企业之间则属于相对独立的外部关系。政企关系本质上涉及政府与企业及市场的边界划分,因此解析政企关系可以帮助我们进一步理解地方政府在地区经济和社会发展中的职能和作用,从而进一步揭示地方政府的性质和特征。

我们研究政企关系性质及其变迁是第6章提出的“官场+市场”分析框架的应用和延伸。不同历史时期的政企关系特征是由地方政府的职能特征和地方官员的激励所塑造的,官场竞争在相当程度上决定了政企关系的性质及其变化。我们反复强调,对于中国这样一个兼具转型和发展双重特征的国家来说,强大的政府与相对弱小的非国有企业之间容易导致政府的“掠夺之手”的各种行为,对非国有企业的成长和区域经济发展构成巨大的威胁。围绕着经济增长的官场竞争改变了政府单纯的“掠夺之手”,在大多数情况下变成了“帮助之手”,但有时也会变成“闲不住的手”。更重要的是,“官场+市场”的双层市场结构使得地方官员和民营企业家之间形成了复杂多样的利益交换和捆绑关系,政府与企业的关系更多地变成了官员与企业家的关系,不再是能用简单的“掠夺之手”和“协助之手”可以描述,而是值得我们深入研究。

## 8.1 地方政府与国有企业：历史与现实

新中国成立之初,中国模仿苏联的计划经济模式建立了国有企业的管理制度。由于苏联模式强调中央部门的垂直管理,中国在50年代也成立了许多综合性和专业性的中央管理部门,对企业的经济活动进行严格的控制。企业的生产、物质供应、产品定价与销售以及收入分配完全按照国家的指令性计划进行。在上级主管部门的计划支配下,企业成为政府部门的行政附属物,没有经营的自主权,在功能上像是国家生产的大托拉斯的一个车间,最多是一个成本核算的单位,不具备利润中心或是投资中心的性质。企业的利润全部上缴给政府部门,企业所需的投资和经费也由政府部门拨付,统收统支的财务管理体制使得企业对于节约成本和提高效益缺乏激励。

从传统体制下政企之间关系的上述特征,我们可以很容易理解计划经济时期国有企业经营效率低下的原因。从1958年权力下放运动开始,中国一直试图改革计划体制下权力过于集中、地方政府和国有企业缺乏激励的问题,可以说国有企业经营管理体制的调整与改革一直贯穿了国有企业的整个发展历史。而国有企业的改革几乎都是围绕着政企关系的调整展开的,只是在各个历史时期,关于如何调整政企关系、搞活国有企业的改革思路是不一样的。下面我们先简要描述在计划经济时期政企关系的几次调整及其影响,然后再详细讨论1978年之后的国有企业改革的基本思路的演化。[^2]

50年代中期,随着中国社会主义“三大改造”任务的基本完成,各种私有经济成分逐渐消失,公有制经济占据了主导地位,国家的经济活动也基本纳入中央的计划范围之内。但人们很快就认识到这种计划体制赋予地方政府和企业的机动性很小,中央权力过度集中的问题逐渐暴露出来。当时的地方领导人纷纷向中央领导反映,认为中央对经济统得过死,形成了“条条”专政,严重束缚了地方和企业的积极性。于是就有了1958年大规模的“体制下放”的改革,其核心是把大量原来属于中央直接管理的企业下放给地方,同时下放计划管理、基建投资、物质分配、信贷、财政和税收等等权力。

显然,1958年的权力下放体现了当时中央领导人对于改革计划体制弊端的一个主要思路,即当时经济面临的主要问题(如地方和企业缺乏积极性、效益低下)是中央的权力过于集中,责任、权力和利益都集中在中央层面,地方和企业的责、权、利基本被忽视了,而要改变这个局面的一个直接办法就是“体制下放”和“放权让利”,调整政府之间以及政企之间的利益关系,让地方和企业积极参与到整个国家的经济建设上来。在放权让利的过程中,地方政府是主要的受益者,下放的经济管理的权力基本上被地方政府获得,企业仍然是地方政府的行政附属物和计划生产单位。所以这种权力下放属于典型的“行政性分权”,即权力主要从中央政府下放给了地方政府,而没有主要下放给企业。[^3]

大约在相同的时期,苏联在反思其体制弊端的时候,也认识到问题的核心就在于中央垂直部门权力太大,地方(各个共和国)权力太小。因此赫鲁晓夫1957年发动的经济改革决定在全国范围内对工业和建筑业进行改组,遵循着行政性分权的原则,把工业和建筑业的管理权力从中央下放到地方,从过去的中央部门管理改为由地方“国民经济委员会”按地区进行管理,希望通过赋予地方政府更多的经济管理的权力来调动地方政府的积极性,增强经济的活力(吴敬琏等,1993,第102—104页)。

中国的“体制下放”改革确实调动了地方和企业的积极性,地方大上各种基建项目,兴办了许多“五小”工业,职工人数剧增。但在计划经济的体制框架没有触动的局面下,这种积极性的井喷带来的更多是计划失控、生产混乱和通货膨胀。企业之间原有的生产协作关系被打乱了。各地区之间出现了经济封锁和地方保护主义倾向,都希望把原材料和产品留在本地区,用于本地区的经济扩张,而不愿交货给其他地区,地区间的协作关系被打破了。到1959年中央紧急刹车,决定回收下放的权力,重新回到中央集权的体制。

经过1961—1963年的国民经济的恢复与调整,1958年经济“大跃进”造成的经济混乱消失了,财政赤字和信贷失衡都得到了很好的控制,然而中央集权的种种弊端又凸显了。结果从1966年开始,中央又开始酝酿新一轮的放权改革,1970年正式实施。这一轮改革仍然是向地方下放各种经济管理权力,如投资权、物质调配权和财政权,但与此同时强调地方应该尽量建立独立的工业体系,力争做到煤炭、钢铁、电力、农机、轻工业品等生产的自给自足。改革的思路类似,当然结果也类似,1970年的放权造成接下来的几年里全国范围内基建投资失控,财政赤字严重,生产秩序混乱。最后下放的权力悉数被收回。

从1958年至1978年这段时期,中国的政企关系的调整就在“放权—收权”的循环中反复,放权也只是属于行政性分权,在中央与地方政府之间重新分配管理企业的权力,企业经营的自主权问题基本上没有进入当时决策者的视野,因而一直未能形成实质性的改革。

我们需要注意到,计划经济时期中国地方政府对国有企业和地方经济资源的控制能力在不同时期有所波动,时高时低,但是与苏联相比却一直是比较强的。从60年代中期开始中央就开始鼓励地方政府兴办地方工业,建成相对独立的工业体系,这赋予了中国地方政府控制地方经济资源的巨大能力。截至70年代末,中央计划直接控制的产品数目为791种,这个数字在计划经济时期从未超过1000个,中央部委也不超过30个。这意味着绝大部分产品的生产和分配由地方政府控制。而苏联的中央计划经济体系强调区域之间的专业化分工原则,中央政府直接控制了绝大多数国有企业,在70年代末期,苏联国家计划委员会下属的62个部委负责规划和协调4800个计划“定位”和1200万种产品。在这个意义上,在改革之前,中国的经济结构相当于相对分权的M型结构,而苏联的经济结构相当于一个高度集权的U型结构(Qian and Xu,1993)。

“文化大革命”结束之后,国有企业的改革又提上议事日程。此时改革的思路仍然延续传统的“放权让利”的逻辑,但开始把注意力放到了企业改革的问题上。1978—1979年在四川省、北京、天津、上海等地进行“扩大企业自主权”的试点,一方面给企业更多的生产、销售、劳动人事、技术改造、中层干部任免等方面的机动权,另一方面引入企业利润留成制度和职工奖金制度,鼓励企业和职工超额完成指令性计划,更好地进行经济核算。这个改革没有走多远,就遇上了“工资侵蚀利润”的问题,如企业滥发奖金,还有基建规模膨胀的问题,使得政府的财政赤字达到历史上的最高水平,物价水平上升压力不断增大。出现这种问题其实很容易理解:当企业利润留成和职工奖金与企业产值挂钩之后,企业有充分的激励增加投资和其他投入的办法去扩大产值,而不必考虑企业的真实效益,何况在政府和企业信息不对称的情况下,企业有很多办法去增加企业的利润留成和职工的奖金支出,最后企业这些策略行为所造成的社会成本(如巨额的财政赤字和严重的通货膨胀)必然是政府和社会共同埋单。

1980年中国出现了严重的财政赤字。这一年,中央和地方的财政体制实行“分灶吃饭”的财政包干制。1981年初,一些地方政府为了稳定财政收入,对所属企业也实行了“包干加奖励”的办法,即利润(亏损)包干的经济责任制。以利润分成为内容的经济责任制显然受到了农村联产承包责任制的成功经验的启发。这种形式一经推出,就迅速得到了推广,取代了之前的“放权让利”的企业改革思路。据统计,到1981年底,实行这种“盈亏包干”经济责任制的国营企业达到了6.3万家,到1982年底,在县属以上国有企业中,实行工业经济责任制的企业占了80%(汪海波,2001,第64—65页)。经济责任制调动了企业和职工的积极性,然后在传统的不合理的价格体系下,企业赢利增加不一定代表效率的提高。经济责任制明确了企业和国家利益的边界,使得企业有充分的激励去尽可能增加自身的利益,甚至不惜损害国家的利益,出现“利大大干,利小小干,无利不干”的现象。

从1983年开始,鉴于经济责任制带来的经济秩序混乱、财政连年赤字和通货膨胀,中央决定停止承包制的全面推广,转而实行分两步走的“利改税”的改革。第一步利改税改革于1983年6月实施,将以前国有大中型企业原来向主管部门上缴利润的制度,改为国有企业在交纳了毛利的55%的所得税之后,税后利润再一部分上缴给国家,一部分留给企业。1984年10月又进行了第二步利改税改革,即不再实行企业与政府主管部门的利润分成制定,允许全部税后利润留给国有企业,企业自负盈亏。另外,考虑到国家对产品价格的控制,对于面临不同价格的企业来说,很难按照相同的税率交纳所得税,因此,在第二步利改税的方案中,国家还向企业征收一户一率的“调节税”。

利改税将企业对政府承担的责任由以前的行政隶属意义上的利润上缴变成了法律上的纳税义务,这有助于避免利润留成和盈亏包干中经常出现的“争基数、吵比例”现象,可以实现改革设计者预期的目标,即保证在利益分配中国家得大头、企业得中头、个人得小头。这和农村“分田到户”的改革所倡导的“交够国家的,留够集体的,剩下的就是自己的”原则何其相似。但是,分两步走的“利改税”仍然没有给企业创造一个公平的经营环境和合适的经济激励,一户一率的“调节税”实际上让政府可以根据每个企业历史上的赢利状况制定相应的调节税,如果企业赢利能力高,就把调节税定高一点,否则就定低一点,这势必引发“鞭打快牛”的问题,让很多企业感到苦乐不均,没有积极性去提高企业的效益。第二步利改税之后,工业企业的利润严重下滑,从1985年8月一直到1987年3月持续了20个月(汪海波,2001,第223页)。

在大多数国有企业经营状况恶化、国家财政收入下滑的背景下,国务院在1986年进行承包经营责任制试点的基础上,于1987年5月决定全国普遍推广承包经营责任制。承包制的形式多种多样,其中包括“两保一挂”(即保上交利税和技术改造,上交利税与工资总额挂钩),上交利润递增包干,上交基数包干、超收分档分成,亏损包干等等。大约有三分之二的企业承包期在三至四年以上。针对承包制中存在一系列问题,如企业包盈不包亏、承包基数过低、承包缺乏竞争机制等等,1988年国务院又颁布了新的条例加以完善和发展,强调了两方面的内容:一是按照责、权、利相结合的原则,切实落实企业经营管理的自主权,转变企业经营机制;二是按照包死基数、确保上缴、超收多留、欠收自补的原则,确定国家和企业的分配关系。

1987年以后的承包制与1981—1983年第一轮的承包制相比有一些差异值得注意(许卓云,2004,第167页)。第一轮承包制是在政府对企业的直接管理和控制不改变的条件下,单纯对利润上缴进行承包,算是一种“边际调节”;而第二轮的企业承包是在扩大企业各个方面的经营自主权的基础上,实行相对完整的企业经营承包,此时除了企业的利润指标仍由承包合同加以规定外,原来由行政部门下达的其他指令性计划指标已经大部分被取消,企业可以相对自主地做出企业的生产、销售、劳动人事和收入分配的决策。这说明改革的设计者已经把转换企业经营机制,使企业成为一个相对独立的经营者作为企业改革的目标。

改革早期的重点是调整政府与企业的利益关系,通过“放权让利”,引入奖金和企业利润留成,刺激企业和职工的积极性。从80年代中期开始,国有企业进入到大规模的承包制改革阶段。我认为,承包制的改革思路有其必然性,它实际上是“克隆”了中央政府和地方政府的改革模式,以放权和承包制为特征,试图明确界定政府对企业的责任边界(补贴负担)、确保企业利润上缴数额和改进国有企业的经营效率问题。而承包制不仅没有解决政企不分的问题,反而强化了上级主管部门与企业的行政隶属关系和依附关系,因为企业最后签订的承包合同的条件(如承包基数)以及事后的修改都依赖于双方的讨价还价,尤其是要以地方政府的态度为转移。

第二轮承包制改革仍然面临着过去经历的老问题,比如政府和企业一对一“争基数、吵比例”的问题,工资侵蚀利润问题,企业苦乐不均和“鞭打快牛”问题,自发涨价以转嫁成本压力的问题,以及奖励、福利基金侵蚀发展基金的问题等等。到了80年代末90年代初,国有企业的经营状况整体上没有摆脱低迷的困境,一般的估计是三分之一明亏,三分之一潜亏,只有剩下的三分之一企业赢利(吴敬琏等,1993,第171页;汪海波,2001,第232页)。

在企业改革成为80年代中后期的改革主线之后,除了普遍推行的承包制和租赁制以外,股份制也作为一种解决政企分开问题、转变企业经营机制的办法而被一些企业所尝试。在很长一段时间里,股份制主要只在少数有条件的国有大中型企业进行试点。比如1984年上海电声总厂发起的上海飞乐音响公司就是我国第一家公开向社会发行股票的股份有限公司。股份制成为国有企业改革的主要形式是在1992年党的十四大召开之后。

1993年中央明确提出了建立社会主义市场经济体制的改革目标。国有企业的改革从以前“放权让利”的思路转变为转换企业经营机制、建立现代企业制度的改革思路,使企业成为自主经营、自负盈亏、自我发展、自我约束的法人实体和市场竞争实体。1994年11月国务院选择了100家国有企业进行建立现代企业制度的试点。但在那个时候,人们对现代企业制度的理解还是非常有限的。事实上,绝大多数参加这一试点的企业只是变成了形式上类似于现代公司的“国有独资公司”,作为现代公司的一个基本要求——股权多元化也没有实现。1997年的中共十五大,特别是1999年中共十五届四中全会进一步明确公司化改制的要求,国有大中型企业的公司化改革才真正进入了按照国际通行规范建立现代公司的阶段(吴敬琏,2003,第146页)。

从90年代中期以后,关于如何搞活国有企业,中央提出了关于“抓大放小”和“对国有企业实施战略性重组”的改革战略。国有企业改革战略的重大调整有着其深刻的背景。随着中国非国有部门的发展,尤其是民营企业的飞速发展和外资企业的大量进入,国有企业面临的市场竞争越来越激烈。在激烈的市场竞争下,低效率的经营机制、沉重的社会包袱和日益严重的亏损使得国有企业举步维艰,难以与其他所有制类型的企业一争高低。从1978年到1996年,经历了18年的改革之后,国有企业在中国工业产值的份额从1978年的接近78%下降到1996年的29%,与此同时,截至1996年,国有企业拥有57%的城市职工,占有工业固定投资的52%的份额,却有超过40%的国有企业处于亏损状态(Lin et al.,1998)。国有企业如果不再进行深刻的改革和战略性重组,继续维持这种不死不活的局面,必然会拖垮国有经济在中国经济中的地位和作用,也最终影响到我国整个经济的发展和资源配置的效率。因此,从90年代中期以后,我国对国有企业改革的战略进行了重大调整,不再局限在“放权让利”和“承包制”这种仅仅强化激励的做法,而是深刻改变国有企业的经营机制和治理结构。具体说来,对大型和中小型国有企业采取了不同的改革策略,对中小型企业采取“放”的办法,允许中小型企业进行改制;对大型国有企业则采取战略重组,进行“公司化”改造,建立现代企业制度和良好的公司治理结构,这包括成立国有资产管理委员,使政府作为所有者的职能与作为监管者的身份相分离;将国有企业的就业创造、社会保障等政府职能进行剥离,交由政府部门去管理,使企业成为一个纯粹的经济组织,由于有这种剥离,国有企业开始出现大规模的下岗工人;将一些大型国有企业重组上市,进行股份化改造,引入多元化的投资者,建立较为合理的公司治理结构,接受资本市场的监督和制约。

## 8.2 地方政府与国有企业：理论分析

前面我们简要描述了地方政府与国有企业关系的历史演变。可以说,政府和国有企业的关系及其变革代表了中国经济体制改革过程中最重要、最深刻的历史变化之一。我们如何理解这种关系变化的性质和内在逻辑呢?

在这种传统体制之下的政企关系有如下几个特点:第一,政府既是国有企业的所有者,又是企业投资和经营活动的宏观管理者,与此同时还是企业产品和服务质量的监管者。政府的多种角色高度合一导致了政府管理企业的多种目标之间的内在冲突,成为传统国有企业经营效率低下的根源之一。第二,企业除了是一个缺乏经营自主权的生产单位之外,作为政府的行政附属物,还承担了许多非生产性的政府职能,如为职工提供医疗卫生、就业、社会保障甚至职工子女教育等等服务,即我们通常说的“企业办社会”,更准确地说,政府把许多政府职责发包给了国有企业,企业成为中国多级行政发包体制下的准行政的基层组织。企业的“准行政”性质特别值得我们注意,因为它决定了在传统体制下国有企业的经营目标的多重性及其内在冲突(赢利目标和履行政府和社会职责之间的矛盾)。第三,企业领导人是由上级主管部门任命,具有通用的行政级别。企业领导人可以平级或提升到政府部门任职,政府部门的官员业可以任命为企业领导人,政府的“官场”与企业的“经理人员市场”的完全合一决定了国有企业的经理具备了政府官员的属性。企业领导人的政府官员属性一方面和企业作为准行政的基层单位的属性相互支持,强化了企业的行政色彩,另一方面也使得企业领导人在经营企业时更像在管理一个行政部门。总之,这些特征清楚地表明国有企业其实就是政府的一个组成部分,属于政府内部的一个有效层级。在这个意义上,我们试图用市场企业的特征去看待这些国有企业是失之偏颇的。

相对于私营企业,国有企业的低效率是各国都能观察到的普遍现象,在社会主义转型国家尤其明显。为什么会出现这种现象?最著名的解释是由匈牙利经济学家雅偌什·科尔奈(Kornai, 1980)提出的,他认为根源在于国有企业面临“软预算约束”。企业经营不善,出现严重亏损时,政府出于“父爱主义”的动机,仍然会出面救助,企业经理如果事前预期到企业亏损之后政府事后会出面救助,那么就没有激励去改善经营,提高效率。正如科尔奈(Kornai,1980,1992)深刻指出的那样,国有企业的低效率以及匈牙利所进行的多次经济改革之所以失败,不在于国有企业或者政府缺乏赢利动机,而在于政府和国有企业之间特有的关系,这种关系类似于一种双头垄断,使得两者处于讨价还价的状态,最终导致预算软约束和经营绩效变差。所以软预算约束现象的存在,关键在于政企关系的特定性质。

对于“软预算约束”造成了国有企业的低效率这一论点,学者之间很少有分歧。然后,关于究竟是什么原因导致了政府的“父爱主义”的倾向和企业的软预算约束,为什么在经济转型过程中国有企业的软预算约束依然存在,不同的理论给出了不同的解释。这些观点对于我们进一步理解政府和国有企业的关系及其演变非常有帮助。下面我们大致梳理一下几种主要的观点,并对它们进行评价,然后提出笔者自己的看法。

根据林毅夫等人(Lin et al., 1998;林毅夫等,1999)的观点,国有企业的软预算约束问题来源于国家赶超战略下企业缺乏自生能力和所承担的政策负担。在传统的小农经济的基础上,国家为了实现重化工业化战略,不得不依靠汲取农业领域的剩余,采取人为扭曲的价格体系(如人为压低农产品价格、抬高工业品价格)实现工业化所需的积累。而为了让国有企业在背离比较优势[^4] 的条件下得以运转,又进一步压低相关要素的价格(如资金利率),并要求国有企业按照严格的投入产出计划进行生产。如果离开了这些扭曲的价格体系的支持,这些背离比较优势的国有企业在竞争性的市场环境中是不具备自生能力的。在这种大背景下,国有企业的亏损有可能是国家在制定和实施计划过程中错误决策所致,比如没有及时给企业提供生产所需的投入,或者计划者对产品需求过于乐观的估计导致产品积压,这样形成的亏损,责任自然应该有国家来承担,而不应该怪罪企业,这是为什么政府动用各种手段(如财政补贴和银行贷款)为亏损企业解困的根本原因。即使企业亏损为企业经理的错误决策所致,但因为信息不对称,政府也无法区分这些亏损是政策性的原因还是经理的原因导致的,只能统一埋单。经济改革以来,虽然企业的自主权不断扩大,但软预算约束仍然存在,这是因为改革之后政府把很多的政策性负担——改革之前由国家的财政负担——交给了国有企业,如职工就业、社会保障和一些仍然扭曲的价格,这些政策性负担使得企业缺乏自生能力,而必须继续依赖政府各方面的帮助。

根据这种观点,政府的“父爱主义”主要源自国有企业所承担的国家赶超战略和许多政策性负担。在国家重化工业化战略下,国有企业作为实现国家的经济赶超战略的重要载体,在扭曲的要素价格和产品价格下经营,盈亏具有严重的政策性因素。如加工工业的利润因为价格的人为抬高而产生,资源品行业、交通和基本服务业的价格被人为压低,经营业绩“先天”不足,唯有少数传奇式的企业家人物可以改变。当价格不再反映资源的相对稀缺程度时,企业的利润也不可能准确反映企业的经营效率。传统计划体制又抑制了企业之间的竞争,政府也就失去了利用市场竞争获得企业经营能力的信息。[^5] 当价格和赢利信号无法传递经营者经营能力和努力的信息时,作为委托人的政府对作为代理人的企业也就失去了间接监督的能力,只能直接监督和控制,以限制经理人可能的自由裁量权。

政府对国企的直接控制和国企的弱激励是和国家赶超战略、扭曲的价格体系互补的机制设计。这是一个非常深刻的观察。换句话说,如果你作为委托人不能明确界定代理人的经营绩效,也就无法界定他的经营责任,自然就不能把自主决策的权力交给他,也不能给予他强力的激励方式,否则下放的权力会被滥用,强激励会被用于委托人不愿看到的用途。在扭曲的价格体系下,下放经营自主权和给予企业高强度的激励(如承包制)会导致经营者利用自由裁量权去损害企业所有者的利益,如人为扩大利润留成比例,滥发奖金,把建设资金用于改善职工的福利,或者把低价调拨的原材料直接卖给市场获利(如果按计划生产可能还需以计划的低价卖出),或者直接转移甚至挥霍国有资产。企业知道,最后体现出来的负利润可以交给政府负责,因为政府无从知道利润为负的真实原因。[^6]

这可以解释为什么计划体制下国有企业缺乏经营自主权,在八九十年代政府迟迟不愿意把经营自主权充分下放给企业。八九十年代学术界和政策界经常指责政府部门一直不落实企业自主权的下放,认为这是政府既得利益在作怪,是政府在“寻租”,呼吁要兑现诺言,把国有企业转换成一个自主经营、自负盈亏的经营主体。从现在的观点看,这些批评和呼吁在当时的背景下有一定的道理,但是,给定当时计划体制尚占据主导地位,价格扭曲仍然非常严重,国有企业仍然承担各种政策性负担,把国有企业转换成一个自主经营、自负盈亏的经营主体是不可能实现的任务,政府保持对国有企业的责任和控制有助于限制企业经理的自由裁量权的滥用,从而保证尚未彻底改革的计划经济的正常秩序。

给予国有企业弱化的经济激励还有更深层的组织设计的考虑。在行政发包体制之下,国有企业不仅仅是一个纯粹的生产经营单位,而是承担了大量的政府职能,如创造就业、提供医疗服务和社会保障等等。从组织设计的角度看,让国有企业同时承担就业和社会保障等政府职能必然会伤害到政府对企业自身的激励安排。如果把企业真正转换成了一个自主经营、自负盈亏的纯经济组织,那么,企业对于保障职工就业和提高职工医疗卫生退休等社会服务的积极性就自然会下降,因为提供这些服务惠及全社会(有利于社会稳定),具有公共产品属性,企业不愿意自己出钱做对全社会都有利的事情,而愿意“免费搭车”。所以为了维持国有企业对履行这些公共职能的激励,就必须让国有企业面临弱的激励,不能使企业真正成为自负盈亏的经营主体(Bai et al.,2000)。这可以解释为什么国有企业的改革相对其他领域的改革是滞后的。虽然改革以来的大部分时间里,国有企业的经营状况一直不能令人满意,甚至有恶化的倾向,国家为了保证社会稳定,宁愿利用政府补贴和银行贷款维持亏损的国有企业,尽量延后国有企业的急进式改革,而其他领域的改革,如乡镇企业和民营企业的崛起,外资的大量引进,也事实上得益于国有企业改革滞后所创造的相对稳定的社会环境。

政府把大量的职能发包给国有企业承担,国有企业以此作为寻求国家补贴和救助的借口,双方进入一种隐含的交换关系,彼此相互依赖,也相互制约,这种双垄断关系也是造成预算软约束的根源之一(Kornai,1980,1992;Walder,1995)。政府依赖国有企业提供就业和社会保障限制了其关闭长期亏损企业的威胁能力,国有企业利用政府的“软肋”以及信息不对称而向政府不断索取各种政策优惠和财政支持。政府和企业的这种交换关系不仅仅限于社会主义转型国家,在市场经济国家也存在。比如政治家为了获得连任或赢得选举,允诺动用国家的财政资金去补贴一些低效率、冗员充斥的国有企业,以财政补贴换取获更多的选票,而这将导致这些国有企业的预算软约束(Shleifer and Vishny,1994)。

计划经济体制下的扭曲的价格体系实际上人为制造了一系列的政策性租金和潜在套利机会。维持计划经济的正常秩序的前提条件是强制要求每个企业必须按照国家指令性计划进行生产和销售,企业的利润和地方政府的财政收入悉数上交。国家对企业的盈亏负责,中央对地方政府的财政支出负责,企业经理和职工最终获得固定工资和福利。企业的自主权被严格限制,企业经理和职工的激励也被弱化,政策性租金基本上变成中央集中控制的资金积累,重点投入到重化工业,由此维持一个内在一致的体制设计。在这方面,地方政府面对中央政府就像企业面对政府一样,其经营自主权和财政激励被限制,以防止地方政府在计划体制下的“套利”行为,如以资源为主的省份也兴办加工业,不愿意把廉价的资源产品白白交给别的省份去加工,而使肥水流入外人田。由此我们也可以理解为什么在传统计划经济时期和改革初期中央和地方的“放权—收权”循环会不可避免。每当基建投资权、物质调配权、信贷权下放给地方政府,地方政府的第一个反应就是拼命扩大基建投资规模,而且是“一窝蜂”式地投入价高利大的加工业(在官方文件里被指责为“重复建设”),以获得计划体制下的“政策性租金”,最后必然导致原材料紧缺,价格上涨压力增大,国家计划严重失衡,经济失去控制,最后必须靠“收权”来控制局面。事实上,在80年代财政包干体制下,各省实行地方封锁和保护主义,也是这种“套利”激励和行为的最好写照。各种大战络绎不绝,如“棉花大战”“羊毛大战”“生猪大战”,在一定程度上是各省争夺“政策性租金”的产物。

国有企业承担的政策负担和社会保障功能以及企业经理的自由裁量权可以解释为什么政府直接控制和管理国有企业并给予后者以弱激励。政府直接控制和管理虽然可以降低代理人成本,但也同时带来政治控制的成本,即政府干预本身可能带来的瞎指挥和管得过死的毛病。在很长一段时间里,国有企业的改革一直面临着“代理成本”和“政治控制成本”的权衡(Qian,1996)。政府和企业(经理)处于典型的委托代理关系上,企业经理的能力和行为的不易观察使得政府与企业之间处于信息不对称的状态。信息不对称加上企业经理自身的目标函数与政府的偏离导致了代理人问题,引发代理成本。放松政治控制(比如放权和增加物质激励)有助于激发企业的积极性,避免政府干预的各种弊端,但是在价格体系扭曲和上级监督不力的情况下也会导致企业滥用权力,如滥发奖金,牺牲企业长期发展潜力的短期行为。可是,如果加紧政治控制,代理人问题会有所缓解,但政治控制的成本随之上升。这就是国有企业改革的两难困境,也是中国进入改革之后政企关系的两难困境。

政企关系中“代理成本”和“政治控制成本”的交替,根源在于改革者把国企改革的思路仅仅局限于扩大企业自主权和增强物质激励,就像改革前中央和地方政府的关系仅仅局限于权力分割和财政激励一样,而没有从根本上改革企业所有制结构、政府体制和公司治理。从1993年开始尤其是1997年之后,国有企业改革进入了一个新的阶段。在这个阶段推行的一系列改革旨在同时降低国有企业的“代理成本”和“政治控制成本”。这主要包括三个方面:(1)国有企业的“去政治化”(depoliticization),即降低政府对企业的行政干预,尤其是政府对企业经理的人事控制;成立国有资产管理委员会,将政府的所有者和监管者的身份加以分离。(2)建立有效的“公司治理结构”,甄别、选择和监督高素质的经理者,并赋予其合适的激励合约。(3)“去社会化”(desocialization),即剥离国有企业的社会负担,使之成为一个纯粹的经济组织。

上述理论从不同的角度,如国有企业承担的赶超战略、政策负担,政企之间的“代理成本”与“政治控制成本”之间的交替,很好地解释了传统体制下政企关系的性质以及国有企业低效率的根源,也有助于帮助人们理解为什么在城市国有企业改革过程中政企难以真正分开,政府不愿意放弃企业的最终控制权,让企业成为自负盈亏、自主经营的主体。但是,关于为什么进入90年代中期以后,国有企业改革会逐渐走向大规模改制的道路,或者说,为什么政府会最终放弃对大多数国有企业的控制权,这背后是什么力量在推动?

如果说从80年代初到90年代中期国有企业的改革(如“放权让利”和承包制)主要是从上到下的过程,即中央在改革设计和实施方面处于主导方面,那么,90年代中期以后的国有企业改制则带有很强烈的自下而上的色彩。1993年山东的诸城和广东的南海率先尝试国有企业的改制,这些做法随后被推广到中国其他地区。为什么从地方政府到中央政府最终会做出出让大多数国有企业产权的决策,是一个值得研究的题目。从已有的研究文献来看,主要由地方主导的国有企业改制,其背后的驱动因素是国有企业大面积亏损、地方政府预算约束硬化和产品市场及资本市场的竞争。产品市场来自民营企业和外资企业的日益激烈的竞争造成了国有企业作为一种企业制度的相对劣势(如产权模糊带来的激励不足)日趋明显,经营绩效每况愈下,地方政府承担的财政补贴也不断增加。这说明地方政府维持国有企业的控制权的收益不断下降,而成本则不断上升(Li and Zhang, 1998)。而1994年的分税制改革大规模调整了中央和地方政府所得的财税份额,地方政府的财政收入大幅度减少,这使得需要持续得到财政补贴的国有企业的命运雪上加霜。另一方面,地区之间日趋激烈的对资本的竞争又进一步使得地方政府补贴国有企业的机会成本上升(Qian and Roland, 1998)。

国有企业大规模的改制标志了政企关系的一次深刻变革,随着绝大多数国有企业的消失,这意味着地方政府对地方经济的干预和管理不再像以前那样具有所有权的基础,相当于公司总部对分公司的关系,或者上级组织对下级组织的关系。在这种情况下,政企关系将如何演化,地方政府在地方经济中的治理作用将如何调整,特别值得我们注意。关于这一点,我们在后文将详细探讨。

## 8.3 地方政府与乡镇企业的兴衰

乡镇企业的兴起和飞速发展是中国工业化过程中的一个独特现象。在其发展的高峰时期,乡镇企业创造的工业产值占全国工业产值的比例接近50%,占国内生产总值的30%左右,吸纳农村富余劳动力1.27亿人。乡镇企业之所以引起国内外学术界的高度关注,原因有二,一是它开创了中国农村工业化的独特道路,通过“离土不离乡”的方式解决了农村庞大的剩余劳动力的转移问题,大大提升了中国工业化的水平;二是地方政府在乡镇企业的迅速发展过程中发挥了决定性的积极作用。在许多发展中国家,农村工业化的困难和失败源于地方政府缺乏激励,不能保证工业发展计划的有效实施。[^7] 乡镇企业中的主要力量——乡办和村办企业——是一种政府所有制,农村私人企业也和政府有着密切的联系。通常人们认为政府所有制是一种低效率的形式,政府管理和控制会妨碍企业发展,然而,正是基层政府所提供的关键性的资源(如信贷)和行政保护,乡镇企业才可以异军突起,发展成中国工业的“半壁江山”。

乡镇企业泛指农村地区所有的非国有企业,主要包括乡办、村办、联户和个体四种形式的企业。本文使用“乡镇企业”主要侧重在乡办和村办企业,因为这两类企业和乡镇政府的关系较为密切。乡镇政府作为乡办企业的投资者和所有者,直接参与企业的管理,关于企业的重大的决策(如投资方向、经理的选任和报酬设计、利润的分配)有支配权。乡镇政府对于企业的管理和控制一般通过成立经济发展公司来实行,经济发展公司如同一个投资公司或控股公司,管理下属众多的乡办和村办企业。即使私有企业也和乡镇政府和村委会存在紧密的联系,因为在土地使用和基础设施(如电力)方面私有企业离不开乡镇政府和村委会的支持和帮助,在改革开放早期私有企业还需乡镇政府提供意识形态的保护(如戴“红帽子”)才能生存。

作为农村的工业企业,乡镇企业起源于人民公社时期的社队企业。在人民公社建立之初,中央提出了发展地方工业、“群众办工业”“社办工业”的政策,人民公社纷纷建立各种小型煤窑、电站、水泥厂、农具修理厂、化肥厂等等。截至1958年底,全国兴办社办工业企业602万个,总产值62.5亿元,约占全国工业总产值的5.8%(张毅等,2001,第5—6页)。后来随着人民公社体制的调整,强调“三级所有,队为基础”,反对公社范围内的“一平二调”,侵占生产队的集体财产,中央逐渐限制公社和大队办企业,到了1962年底,规定公社和生产大队一般不允许办企业,企业由生产队作为一种副业来经营,社队企业受到严重挫折。在70年代初,中央鼓励各省建立独立的工业体系,在农村推行机械化,加上“文革”时期,国家政治经济秩序混乱,反而给予了农村发展社队企业的制度空间,致使各地的“五小”工业遍地开花。据统计,1970—1976年,社队企业产值从92.5亿元增长到272亿元,平均每年递增25.7%;到1978年社队企业数目达到152万个,产值达493亿元(威廉·伯德等,1990,第11页)。

在农村兴办工业,旨在利用农村的剩余资源获取工业和农产品价格的“剪刀差”中的一部分政策租金,相当于让一部分农业剩余回流农村,而这一切可以利用农村大量剩余的劳动力去获取,所以基层政府有相当大的激励去推动社队企业的发展。从国家来说,允许农村进入工业领域,是希望农村地区利用发展工业获得的利润“反哺”农业,减少农村对国家投入的依赖,国家给社队企业设定的“角色”也就基本限于“以工补农”这一点。在当时的计划经济条件下,中央当然不希望看到社队企业突破这个限制性角色,发展到与国有企业争夺市场和资源的地步,干扰传统的工业赶超战略。农村社队工业在计划体制下得以发展被认为是国家的政策让步和城乡之间达成的一种默契:城市给农民一点办工业的权利和空间,以此换取农民继续承担向城市提供低价农产品的义务,农民可以拥有独立国家控制之外的工业资产,以补偿他们在土地所有权上的损失。[^8]

中央对社队企业采取的限制性政策在改革开放之后的一段时间里得以延续,每当经济增长放缓、市场竞争激烈时,乡镇企业经常被指责与国有企业争市场、争资金、争原材料而受到限制。1987年邓小平感叹“乡镇企业异军突起,出乎我们的意料”,说明乡镇企业并未进入中央计划发展的议事日程,乡镇企业的活力也自然被中央政策制订者所低估。

虽然,在国家政策方面,与国有企业相比,乡镇企业面临诸多限制和歧视,但是,从80年代以来仍然获得了迅速的发展。从1978年至1993年,乡镇企业在全国工业产值的比重从只有9%增长到36%,即所谓的“三分天下有其一”。在这一段时间里,民营企业虽然也取得了惊人的增长,但在工业产值的比重上无法与乡镇企业相比,而同一时期国有企业经营状况却一直不能令人满意,无论是产值还是就业量的贡献份额均面临不断下降的局面。在生产效率方面,乡镇企业也有不俗的表现。据估计,从1988年至1992年,国有部门的全要素生产率年度增长2.5%,城市集体部门为4.9%,乡镇企业为6.9%。同一时期的劳动生产率的增长则分别为4.7%,13.8%和17.7%(Jefferson,1994)。为什么在80年代至90年代这段时期内乡镇企业能够异军突起、一枝独秀呢?

学术界比较一致的观点认为,乡镇企业的崛起主要归因于地方政府的积极支持和参与。与中央长期的限制和保留态度相对照的是基层政府对兴办和经营乡镇企业的巨大的热情。在这方面,农村乡村工业的崛起和1979—1980年全国农村悄悄试行联产承包责任制有些类似。地方政府为什么在中央政策限制的情况下仍然愿意积极支持和参与乡镇企业的成立和发展呢?这背后主要受到在财政包干制下基层政府的财政激励的驱动(Whiting,1995;Oi,1996)。财政包干体制下乡镇政府成为新增财政收入的剩余索取者或者重要分享者。乡村企业给乡镇政府创造三部分的收入,一是与上级政府分享的税收;二是企业上缴的利润,乡办企业把利润交给乡政府,村办企业交纳给村委会;三是管理费用,这部分费用不限于乡办和村办企业,私人企业也需交纳。除了第一部分的税收收入需要和上级政府分享之外,剩下的收入来源均属于乡镇政府预算外收入和自筹资金,不需要与上级政府分享,百分之百由乡镇政府支配。兴办乡镇企业可以创造财政资源,增加乡镇政府的财政自主权,支持乡镇政府日益扩张的支出需要,尤其是预算外的支出需要。[^9] 乡镇和村干部的收入也和当地的乡村企业的发展紧密相关,尤其对于村干部来说,他们不属于国家正式的干部,其收入和各项补助高度依赖于社区的收入,尤其是村办企业的产值和利润。除了正式的收入,乡镇干部从控制乡镇企业的过程中还可以获得一些控制权的私人收益,比如在企业的关键性岗位上安插自己的家庭成员,把集体财产变相“私有化”,转化为个人财产等等,这也是不可忽略的一个重要方面。

财政激励只是乡镇干部积极参与乡镇企业经营和管理的一部分。乡镇企业的发展有利于乡镇官员实行上级政府下达的经济发展的强制性指标,成为其重要的政绩,对其未来的政治晋升创造重要条件。许多实地调查的观察验证了乡镇干部发展乡镇企业背后的晋升激励。[^10] 政治晋升激励的存在也会进一步强化乡镇政府的财政激励,只有当乡镇政府控制了大量的财政资源,才有可能去推动各种经济项目,做出令上级领导印象深刻的政绩。财政和政治晋升激励结合起来可以很好地解释乡镇干部直接参与乡镇企业管理的强烈兴趣。

乡镇政府不仅有强烈的激励,而且有能力为乡镇企业的发展做出独特的贡献。事实上,在当时市场经济尚不完善条件下,乡镇政府控制了非常重要的制度和经济资源,比如土地使用、基础设施、贷款担保、财政支持、风险分担、意识形态保护等等。这些资源是当时的纯粹的民营企业所没有的。在这个意义上,乡镇政府的独特作用体现在对市场的替代,这种替代在改革开放早期极其重要。Oi(1992,1996)把乡镇政府比喻成“政治企业家”(political entrepreneurs),他们在农村工业化中发挥的作用比喻为“地方国家社团主义”(local state corporatism)。

然而,财政和晋升激励解释了乡镇企业何以快速发展,这些激励同样存在于乡镇以上的地方政府。但是为什么在相当长的时期内乡镇企业会获得比国有企业和民营企业更快的发展?Che和Qian(1998)提供了一个内在一致的解释。他们把乡镇企业的组织边界定义在社区水平上,而非单个的企业水平上,这样一来,乡镇企业就是社区所有制的企业,它的所有者是社区所有的成员,社区成员委托乡镇政府监督和控制社区里的所有企业,乡镇政府相当于一个M型公司的董事会,拥有公司事务的关键性控制权,而社区内的乡镇企业就相当于公司下属的相对独立的分公司、分支机构和部门(Che and Qian,1998)。乡镇政府的权力具有两个基本特征:一是乡镇政府同时负责社区内的公共事务和经济事务,公共事务包括为社区提供地方性公共产品和执行上级政府的指令,如基础设施建设、教育、计划生育等;二是乡镇政府对国有金融机构的影响力非常有限。这两个基本特征可以解释为什么社区所有的乡镇企业会拥有比国有企业和民营企业更有利的比较优势。民营企业在改革开放早期一直受到意识形态方面和政策的歧视,严重缺乏司法和政策上的产权保护,在银行贷款上几乎不可能,发展面临诸多的制约。相对民营企业来说,乡镇企业更不可能受到国家意识形态和政策的歧视。原因在于,乡镇政府用经营企业获得的收益提供社区性公共产品,如投资基础设施,可以增加企业未来的生产率和国家税收,使国家也从中受益,而民营企业则没有提供公共产品的激励。乡镇政府经营企业更容易和国家所关心的利益(如税收)相一致,从而得到国家方面更多的支持(包括意识形态和政策方面的支持)。乡镇政府积累的固定资产也可以为乡镇企业贷款提供抵押和担保,缓解企业面临的金融约束。

乡镇企业作为一种集体所有制,也是一种产权界定模糊的制度安排,那为什么会比国有企业更有效率呢?根据Che和Qian(1998)的解释,关键在于企业面临的预算约束的差别。国有企业低效率的源泉来自软预算约束,政府利用对国有银行的控制为亏损企业延长或增加贷款。作为中国最基层的政权组织的乡镇政府,并不直接拥有自己的银行机构,[^11] 对设在乡镇的国有银行贷款决策的影响力非常有限,这实际上也就使得乡镇政府事后通过银行贷款救助企业变得非常困难,预算约束变得更硬。正因为不存在事后的救助机制,乡镇企业事前就必须努力经营,最大限度避免企业破产和清偿的可能性。[^12]

关于乡镇企业在中国经济转型中的成功表现,Walder(1995)也给出了一个富有启发意义的解释,和Che和Qian(1998)提出的解释既有联系也有区别。乡镇企业和城市国有企业同样是公有制企业,同样为政府所占有和管理,为什么两者会呈现出系统的经营效率的差别呢?过去人们习惯把公有制企业与软预算约束直接挂钩,认为任何由政府经营的企业都必然是低效率的。这种观点隐含的一个基本假定是在任何层级上政府的预算约束以及政府与企业的关系都是同质和固定的。而问题的关键就在于,在中国,政府所掌握的资源、对下属企业的监督和管理能力以及政府和企业之间的关系依不同的行政层级而呈现系统的差别。比如以1990年的天津市为例,市属国有企业有3251个,而县区所属的企业数平均为89个,乡镇所属的企业数平均为10个,村委会所属的企业则平均只有2个。这说明随着政府的层级越低,政府监督企业的能力越强。而与此同时,随着政府层级的降低,政府所控制的金融和企业间再分配的资源也就越少,对亏损企业的救助能力也就越低,因而企业所面临的预算约束也就越硬。随着公有企业的行政级别的降低,企业所承担的职工的就业、社会保险的责任也越少,解雇个人和清偿企业也就变得更为容易。按照公有制企业行政隶属关系的这种结构性差异,乡镇企业处于最低端,地方政府的监督能力最强,企业面临的预算约束最硬,亏损企业破产成本最小,企业破产对企业的潜在威胁最大。这些特征可以很好地解释乡镇企业为什么比城市国有企业更有效率(Walder,1995)。

与Walder结构性分析相近的一个观察是:中国不同所有者层级的公有制企业实际上存在一个严格的等级结构。[^13] 就像农民的地位低于城市居民,村干部的地位低于乡干部,普通农民的地位低于村干部一样,企业的地位也存在相应的等级差别:地方所有的国企不如中央的国企,乡办企业不如城市的国营、集体企业,村办企业又不如乡办企业。企业的行政隶属的政府级别越高,它从政府那里得到的优惠和资源(比如物质分配、信贷指标和利率优惠)越多,职工的就业保障越好,因而安全感越强。但另一方面,企业的行政级别越低,企业利益与所有者利害关系越直接、越明确,产权关系相对越清晰。到了村办企业,有时我们不容易区分它们是村委会办的,还是村干部办的。而这种企业产权的等级序列赋予了乡村企业相对于国有企业更强的激励和市场适应力。

改革开放以来,乡镇企业作为非国有的乡村企业,其发展并不是一帆风顺的,经历了一些曲折和反复,曾经有一个“四上四下”的波浪式的发展历程(张毅等,2001,第5—6页)。这个发展过程有一个很重要的特征,那就是每当经济出现过热、中央加紧宏观调控的时候,乡镇企业往往首当其冲,被一些政府部门指责为罪魁祸首而加以种种限制。党的十一届三中全会之后,中央提出“社队企业要有一个大发展”,使得社队企业如雨后春笋般涌现,1980年增长速度达到20.5%。然而,当中央为了纠正“洋跃进”带来的经济过热时,社队企业被指责为“以小挤大”,“与国有企业争能源、争市场、争资金、争原料”,1981年发展速度降为10.5%。类似这样的限制还发生在1985—1986年和1989—1990年,其中最严重的是1989—1990年,中国经济面临严重的困难,一些人提出“坚决压乡办企业,保国有工业”,使得乡镇企业的发展受到很大的阻碍。

Che和Qian(1998)以及Walder(1995)从乡镇政府与乡镇企业的治理结构和组织结构的特征出发解释了乡镇企业独有的经济活力。但是,我们需要进一步解释的现象是,乡镇企业在中国当时的意识形态下,和国有企业相比,属于“没有爹妈的孩子”,不时受到一些中央部门的政策限制,但与此同时又得到了地方政府的尤其是基层政府的大力支持。如果说中央政府要监督乡镇政府的“违规”行为非常困难的话,县市政府则要相对容易多了。离开了地方政府尤其是基层地方政府(如县乡政府)的默许和支持,乡镇企业是不可能如此迅猛增长起来的。进一步说,如果我们把乡镇企业理解为一种制度变迁的过程,我们就必须深入理解它背后所涉及的不同利益集团的冲突及其解决。乡镇企业是如何在这种利益冲突的夹缝中成长的?它成长的政治经济学基础是什么?

为了理解这些问题,我们需要看到中央政府和和地方政府在维持国家统一的经济政策方面的不同激励,而两者之间的不同的利益计算为乡镇企业创造了重要的生存和发展空间。

从中央政府来说,乡镇企业的发展固然有很多好处,比如解决农村剩余劳动力的转移问题,实现“以工补农”,增加农民的收入,但是乡镇企业的迅猛发展必然在产品市场、要素市场上和国有企业进行竞争,乡镇企业自身相对灵活和有效的经营机制给后者带来巨大的压力和严峻的挑战。事实上从80年代中期以来国有企业的经营困难有很大一部分原因来自乡镇企业的竞争。如果要在国有企业和乡镇企业之间进行选择,那当然要保护国有企业的利益,这是为什么每当乡镇企业和国有企业竞争激烈的时候,中央层面就会有一些部门出台一些政策抑制乡镇企业的发展。国有企业尤其是大型国有企业可以对中央部门施加非常重要的影响,当它们的利益受损的时候,自然会利用其影响力去左右中央层面的决策。[^14]

然而,到了地方政府,关于乡镇企业发展的成本和收益的计算和中央政府的计算就不完全一样。关于这种差异性,我们可以有两个基本观察。第一,乡镇企业的发展所带来的对国有企业的“负面”影响从地方政府的角度来看比从中央政府的角度看要小得多,因为地方政府所关心的乡镇企业对国有企业的“负面”影响只限于本地区的属于地方政府所有的国有企业,而那些中央国有企业以及其他地区的国有企业所受到的影响则不在考虑的范围之内。换句话说,对于乡镇企业发展的负面外溢效应,中央政府有充分的激励将它完全内在化,而地方政府只愿意局部内在化。在许多地区,地方政府对乡镇企业采取“放水养鱼”的政策,对其偷漏税的情况“睁一只眼闭一只眼”,甚至还出台减免税政策对乡镇企业予以扶持。第二,如果本地区的乡镇企业主要与外地的国有企业进行在产品和要素市场上竞争,或者说以出口为导向,那么它们对本地区的国有企业的负面影响就会降低到最低限度。这种“输出负面影响”的可能性对中央政府来说则基本上不具备,除非中国的乡镇企业完全以出口为导向。[^15]

根据上述两个基本观察,我们可以导出几个有意义的推论,解释我们所观察到的乡镇企业发展的一些规律性的特征。首先,地方政府的层级越低,需要“内在化”乡镇企业负面溢出效益的范围和程度就越低,发展乡镇企业的激励越高。这可以解释乡镇政府推动乡镇企业的激励为什么最强,因为在乡镇一级没有国有企业存在,发展乡镇企业只有各种益处,而无任何负面效应。由乡镇政府上溯,国有企业逐渐变得越来越重要,发展乡镇企业的激励依次递减。这里我们引入不同层级政府在计算溢出效应时所呈现的差异性可以看作是对Walder(1995)理论的进一步拓展。其次,在国有企业越发达的地方,乡镇企业的发展受到抑制的可能性越大。这可以解释为什么以国有经济占据主导地位的东北地区乡镇企业的发展相对缓慢的原因,也可以解释为什么浙江省是中国乡镇企业相对发达的地区,尤其是温州和台州地区,因为浙江的国有经济一直相对薄弱,而温州和台州则更是如此。再次,地方政府更希望乡镇企业和本地区的国有企业之间形成互补关系(如上下游的加工关系),把产品输往外地甚至国外销售,所以乡镇企业的外向发展应该是受到鼓励的发展方向。要建立这一推论的有效性尚需在大样本的微观数据上进行严格的计量分析和检验,但是一些粗略的观察似乎也支持这种假说。比如乡镇企业在其早期阶段主要为国有企业带料、带设备加工,在后来的发展过程中乡镇企业与国有企业的上下游的加工关系甚至合作关系还是较为普遍的。在80年代早期,中国尚处于短缺经济时代,市场上还有很多的未被国有企业满足的需求,在这个阶段上乡镇企业的发展还不会危及国有企业的利益,所以发展空间很大。这也可以解释为什么到了宏观经济紧缩和调整的时候反对乡镇企业的声音最大,因为这个时候乡镇企业和国有企业的利益冲突最严重。另外,乡镇企业虽然在技术、资本规模和人力资本方面均大大落后于国有企业,但它在产品市场的开拓方面(包括产品出口比例)仍然是惊人的。2000年,在乡镇企业对国内生产总值的贡献为30.5%的情况下,它的出口交货值占到全国出口交货值的40%(张毅等,2001,第167页)。

不同层级的政府在内在化乡镇企业发展的溢出效应的差异也可以用于解释它们之间对民营经济的态度差异。在民营经济发展的早期,最大的障碍来自国家意识形态和经济政策的严重歧视。民营经济被认为是与社会主义格格不入的所有制形态,也是潜在对国有企业构成威胁的力量。但是基层政府对于维护这种意识形态的积极性显然不如中央政府和上级的地方政府那样大,在这类问题上,越是基层的政府可能越“实际”。乡村民营经济在其发展的早期阶段,完全依靠乡镇政府睁一只眼闭一只眼而得以生存,一些地区甚至发明了“戴红帽子”的方法——即把民营企业冠名为“集体企业”,对民营企业加以保护。[^16] 在温州地区,民营经济非常发达,而这种以民营经济为基础的工业化在其发展的大部分阶段却没有得到浙江省政府的明确认可和政策支持,而省政府的“无为而治”政策就属于最大的支持了。有人做过专题研究,在1978年至1996年间,浙江省一级政府就几乎未曾就鼓励私营经济发展的问题颁发过任何文件,而对于如何搞好国有企业,却发了大量的文件(史晋川等,2004,第46页)。1996年宁波市开始对集体企业和国有企业进行大规模改制,许多国有企业被转让,大批工人下岗,这种改制的做法曾受到浙江省委、省政府的质疑,针对宁波专门发了文件,予以批评,让有些县领导感到不安。但是当年一些县区一级分管企业的县(区)长是改革非常坚定的支持者,他们对上面的答复是“文件精神不容易理解,需要反复学习领会”,以此顶住压力继续进行集体企业的产权转让(王云帆,2008,第134页)。

虽然从总体上说,基层政府和村一级行政组织对于乡镇企业的飞速发展发挥了关键性的作用,但是,我们也需要看到,地方政府所扮演的角色存在巨大的地区差异。乡镇企业发展在中国有三个最著名的模式,即“温州模式”“苏南模式”与“珠江模式”。这三个模式中地方政府所发挥的作用就差异很大。下面我们侧重讨论温州模式与苏南模式的区别。

温州地区自80年代初以来在区域经济发展和制度创新方面走出了一条独特的道路,被学术界概括为“温州模式”。[^17] 温州模式的主要特点是,以个体民营经济(家庭和联户经营)为主体,依靠温州地区大量在外商人开拓的巨大的市场渠道和网络,进行专业化的生产和集聚,依托城镇形成大型的专业化市场,由此带动城镇化和工业化的发展。在80年代初期,中国尚处在计划经济体制之下,私营经济作为“资本主义的尾巴”,还是被主流意识形态严厉批判的对象,温州地区却能够发展出极具活力的民营经济,不能不说是一个奇迹。而这一方面反映了温州地区历史悠久的经商传统所孕育的企业家精神,另一方面则离不开当地基层政府别具一格的“产权保护”和政策扶持。地方政府在温州农村企业崛起的过程中一直扮演了“协助之手”的作用。

这里我们可以举几个例子加以说明地方政府和基层干部在温州模式中的积极作用。首先是“挂户经营”的创举。在80年代初,因为意识形态的原因,温州地区有许多以隐蔽形式存在的家庭工业,即所谓的“地下家庭加工厂”。由于在国家工商管理系统中没有合法身份,这些各自分散的家庭企业在经营上面临许多现实的约束,如无法向客户提供介绍信、合同书和银行账户。1980年,温州苍南县金星大队率先实现了制度创新,挂出了“金星大队文具厂”的牌子,对外统一厂名、银行账号、统一纳税、上缴管理费等等,内部则实行分户生产,这就是温州首创的“挂户经营”模式(同上,第45页)。这既解决了家庭私人经营的社会身份问题,也同时给生产大队提供了稳定的收入来源(管理费),是一种“双赢”的设计。所以,“挂户经营”很快被其他地区纷纷仿效。第二个例子是“股份合作制”的合法化。随着温州家庭工业发展,一种股份合作的新型所有制形式大量涌现,据统计,至1986年,温州全市各种形式的合股工业企业已达1万余家,其产值占到全市工业产值的27%(余映丽等,2002,第98页)。然而,股份合作在当时不被法律所承认,国家工商管理部门只认可国家、集体、个人三种企业性质。1986年有戴红帽子的企业因为合伙分掉了所赚的利润而被刑事拘捕,以贪污罪判刑。为了支持股份合作企业的发展,温州市政府在1987年11月颁布了《关于农村股份合作企业若干问题的暂行规定》,把股份合作企业定位是“一种新型的合作经济组织”,不属于私营合伙企业,为当时不被法律承认的股份合作企业开绿灯,戴“红帽子”,也是中国首次为股份合作制正名。第三个例子是90年代以来温州地方政府积极提供地方性公共产品,大力投资基础设施建设。在90年代以前,温州城市基础设施非常落后,交通不便,既无铁路,也无航空,只有水路和崎岖不平的公路,供电严重不足,缺乏基本的环境卫生设施。这些落后的基础设施条件严重制约了当地经济的进一步发展。从90年代以来,在地方政府积极推动和大力组织下,温州基础设施发生了巨大的变化,建成了金温铁路、机场及大型跨江大桥,修建了国家级高速公路,完成22万伏输变电工程3座,引进50万门程控电话设备,还对温州旧城进行了改造,彻底改善了城市的道路、供水、医疗、环境卫生等基础设施条件(史晋川等,2004)。

与饱受质疑和争议的“温州模式”相比,“苏南模式”长期受到领导层和学术界的青睐。著名社会学家费孝通曾经说过“苏南模式的今天就是其他地区的明天”。原因很简单,苏南模式是以乡村集体企业为主体,乡镇干部直接控制和管理企业,借助苏南邻近上海的地理优势,推动农村的城镇化和工业化。如果说地方政府在温州模式中只是扮演了“协助之手”的作用的话,在苏南模式中,地方政府直接作为企业的所有者和经营者,发挥着强势政府的作用。乡镇政府之于乡镇企业,就像公司总部之于分公司之间的关系一样密切。造成这个显著特点的一个历史原因是,苏南一带自新中国成立以来农业一直面临繁重的征粮任务,为了保证粮食高产,一方面不准小队兴办企业,害怕影响农业生产,另一方面又在公社和大队两级办工业,补偿小队粮食生产的高投入。这样一来,生产小队、大队虽然在名义上有很大的独立性,但实际上受到公社强有力的控制。[^18] 一直以来高压力的征购任务和高度发达的集体经济为乡镇干部掌握农村关键性的经济和政治资源奠定了重要条件,也自然孕育了一批精明能干的乡镇干部。80年代以来风靡全国的“苏南模式”其实是70年代社队企业发展的延续。

进入90年代中期以后,随着中国宏观经济的“软着陆”,加上亚洲金融危机的冲击,乡镇企业面临了严重的经营困难,大量的乡镇企业亏损严重,负债累累,以集体企业为主的苏南模式自然也遭受了最为严重的打击,被称为“二国营”的集体乡镇企业的各种问题逐渐暴露出来,如产权模糊,政企不分,内部管理混乱和干部腐败等等,致使曾经领先的江苏经济被民营经济发达的浙江和广东所超过。为了摆脱困境,90年代末,江苏开启了大规模的由乡镇政府主导的乡镇企业改制运动,大多数集体乡镇企业被改制为股份制或股份合作企业。

非常有意思的现象是,苏南在2000年以后又进入经济高速增长时期,其中一个至关重要的增长点来自吸引外商直接投资。2005年江苏实际利用外资132亿美元,2006年为174亿美元,连续四年居全国首位,创造了以不到全国1%的土地面积吸引了全国近五分之一的外资的惊人成绩。苏南地区实现了从集体经济向外资和民营经济的跳跃与转型,然而,这一切的实现仍然借助了苏南模式中已经包含的比较优势——相对强势和有效的基层地方政府。不过此时已不再是由地方政府直接经营和控制企业,而是转变成如何为企业提供高效的公共服务,扮好“协助之手”的角色。对于外商投资来说,最重要的是投资环境,而投资环境包含“硬件”设施(如道路交通)和“软件”设施(政府政策和服务)两个方面,都离不开一个高效清廉的政府服务,尤其要从外商聚集地的珠江三角洲那里把外商吸引过来,更需要靠优于别的地区的政策环境和政府服务。这正是苏南地区的比较优势所在。这里试举两例(王云帆,2008,第222、227页)。在有“小台北”之称的江苏昆山市,在其开发区的网页上有这样的承诺:“台商有什么困难,大到项目审批,小到生活服务,包括就医、小孩上学都可以打市领导的手机,都可能得到满意的答复。”昆山市政府官员奉行的服务原则是“对外资不能说不”。苏州是江苏吸引外资的重镇,截至2006年世界500强有113家落户苏州工业园区,实际利用外资接近62亿美元,园区管委会的高效服务和亲商态度有口皆碑,管委会的一些工作人员甚至为台商操办丧事。需要指出的是,在各地花样不断翻新的招商引资政策和服务背后是各个地区之间激烈的竞争,不仅仅是省与省之间(如江苏与广东之间),包括江苏省内各个城市之间的招商引资竞争。

从90年代中期开始,曾经作为中国农村工业化最重要力量的乡镇企业逐渐进入了衰落期,到2004年,乡镇企业创造的增加值在农村非农部门的比重从90年代中期的70%以上降至10%左右,创造就业的比重也从50%降至10%(Kung and Lin,2007)。这期间,各地的乡镇企业经历了一个大范围以明晰产权为核心的改制和民营化过程。到今天,乡镇企业已经基本变成了一个历史名词。

为什么乡镇企业会最终退出历史舞台?对此学术界比较一致的观点认为,乡镇企业兴盛于中国经济改革和发展的特殊阶段,得益于当时的一些制度和经济环境的独特因素,90年代中期以来随着那些支持乡镇企业成长的独特因素逐渐消失,其衰落就变得不可避免。[^19] 80年代和90年代初,在意识形态和产权保护不利于民营企业以及中国尚处于短缺经济阶段赋予了乡镇企业迅速成长的土壤和空间,而乡镇企业的控制者乡镇政府又面临着比更高层政府更硬的预算约束和更激烈的市场竞争,这些因素奠定了乡镇企业独特的比较制度优势。邓小平南方谈话之后,中国市场化进程加速,民营企业获得了更为宽松的政策环境;随着短缺经济的消失,产品市场竞争的激烈程度不断上升,企业利润下降,乡镇企业模糊的产权安排的弊端逐渐显露,民营企业的制度优势压过了乡镇企业,这是乡镇企业最终走向改制和民营化的根本原因。

据Kung和Lin(2007)的研究,乡镇企业的衰落也和乡镇干部的财税激励和晋升激励有着密切的联系。在财政包干体制下,乡镇政府从乡镇企业获得最大的税收来源来自销售收入的营业税,而来自利润的所得税只占25%。为了最大化实现财政收入目标和经济发展的政绩目标,乡镇干部不遗余力地追求乡镇企业的销售收入的增长,而忽略企业的利润指标。在短缺经济条件下,市场竞争有限,追求规模和销量的经营方式尚有生存和发展空间。90年代中期以前银行信贷权的下放也让乡镇企业比较容易获得银行和信用社的贷款。当民营企业崛起之后,在市场竞争日趋激烈的环境下,追求销售增长的乡镇企业与利润最大化的民营企业相比越来越失去市场竞争力。90年代中后期的银行改革上收了基层银行的信贷权,严格了金融机构的信贷管理和责任追究,乡镇企业的信贷扩张遇到体制约束。90年代后期乡镇企业居高不下的债务比例和经营亏损最终引发了大规模的改制和重组。

乡镇企业的兴衰深刻地诠释了中国改革初期政企关系的性质及其影响。乡镇企业的出现使中国各级地方政府第一次面临了国有企业之外的企业主体,在中央层面的政策环境并非有利的条件下,地方政府、尤其是基层政府对乡镇企业的保护和支持是乡镇企业突破政策束缚、享受优于民营企业的制度环境的重要前提。从地方政府与乡镇企业的紧密关系中我们看到了两者的利益交换与双赢合作:地方政府从乡镇企业的发展中获得显著的财源和政绩,乡镇干部也获得了可观的收入,而乡镇企业则获得了在国家计划体制之外快速发展所需的政策保护、贷款支持和其他相关资源(比如从国家物质供应计划中获得一些原材料)。当然这种政企的紧密关系在中国经济市场化进程中日益成为乡镇企业“不能承受之重”。政府和官员的政绩偏好和激励并非朝着企业利润最大化的方向发生作用,其实经常与之相左和抵牾,而政府的支持也时常引致企业的预算软约束问题,最终导致乡镇企业在与民营企业的竞争中败北。这种“成也政企关系,败也政企关系”的结局在后来地方政府与民企的关系中也不断再现,具有某种宿命和悲剧的性质。

## 8.4 从政企关系到官商关系

在国有企业和乡镇企业占主导的时代,从控制权意义上说,企业只是政府的附属物,如同政府的一个部门或分支机构,政企关系更像是政府内部的关系。随着国有企业和乡镇集体企业大规模改制,民营和外资企业大规模进入制造业和服务业,政企关系的性质和特征发生了根本性变化。90年代后期以来,各级地方政府面对最多的企业是非国有企业,不再存在所有权的联系。当政府与企业失去了天然的产权联系而相对独立,传统的“父爱主义”不复存在,而政府手中不受约束的权力横亘在众多企业面前,营商环境和政商关系就成为企业成长和区域经济发展至关重要的决定因素。在这种新的条件下,政府和企业之间的关系有何引人注目的变化呢?我们如何概括这种新型政企关系的性质和特征呢?

从法理上说,地方政府与民营和外资企业完全不存在行政隶属和产权关系。这些非国有企业依靠市场也可以获得生产所需的关键性要素,如资本、劳动和技术,但这并不意味着企业在现实中与政府保持“井水不犯河水”的关系而自主经营,凭借自身的实力在市场上获得一席之地。我们看到的现象是,地方政府与辖区内的各式企业仍然保持千丝万缕的联系,尤其与大企业的关系非同一般。

经过30多年的经济转型和市场经济的发展,地方政府手中所拥有的经济权力发生了诸多变化,比如产品的价格制订权、企业的生产计划和物质调配都不再属于政府的权限范围,而基本交给市场和企业自主决定。从这个角度说,30多年的改革开放削弱了地方政府手中原有的一部分权力,也彻底改变了当地企业对于地方政府的行政隶属关系。但是从另外一方面看,原来属于中央控制的许多权力经过多年的“行政性分权”改革下放给了地方政府,地方政府的经济权力迅速扩张,地方政府对当地的市场与企业仍然具有决定性的影响力。更关键的是,地方政府依据其经济监管和综合治理的角色,对市场和企业的干预能力并没有发生质的变化,甚至有所加强。简单列举一下,地方政府至少拥有以下方面的重要权力:(1)本地经济发展的年度计划和长期规划,制定长远发展战略和产业政策;(2)财政资金的支配权和通过政府担保对银行信贷的影响力,以及对地方金融机构(城市商业银行)的控制力;(3)通过制订和提供各种优惠政策招商引资,改变和引导企业决策;(4)项目的审批权;(5)土地出让和用途管制;(6)实施合同和协调纠纷;(7)对市场和企业行使监管和执法的权力。事实上,地方政府仍然控制了地方经济中几乎所有的关键性生产要素和政策资源(如资金、土地、项目审批、政府补贴、税收征收与减免、劳动力政策、监管和执法),进而对企业和当地经济发展可以施加决定性的影响。从整体上说,在改革开放时代,地方政府的行政和经济管理权力实际上没有被根本削弱,对辖区内企业和市场的影响在某些领域反而有可能变大了。自2013年以来新一届政府大力推动“简政放权”和权力的“责任清单”和“负面清单”。在各个部门梳理权力清单时发现政府各部门仍然控制了4000—5000项审批和监管权限,这已经是在改革开放历时30多年、多次政府机构改革和权力下放之后的状况。

更关键的是,地方政府除了拥有上述正式的权力,还有很多隐性的权力(如自由裁量权),既可以帮扶企业成长,也可以随时转化成“合法伤害权”,威胁到民营企业的经营状况乃至生死存亡。政府的公安、安监、消防、城管、税务、卫生、质检、环保等部门均具有执法权限,在现实中如何拿捏执法的尺寸就很重要。当弱小的民企面对强大的政府,政府的这些监管和执法权限在某些情况下变成了企业的“掠夺之手”。广东省清远县的环保局局长叫嚣“我分分钟消灭一间工厂”,河北省廊坊市供水公司总经理马超群以停水相要挟获得巨额贿赂,成为“小官巨贪”的典型,这些绝对不是孤立的例子。

从行政发包制的视角看,公共事务的层层分包赋予了地方承包方许多实际控制权,权力向第一责任人的集中(即所谓的“一把手”现象)使得各级地方政府的“人治”色彩突出。企业经常不清楚是在与官员打交道还是在与政府打交道,官员的承诺(包括政府发布的“红头文件”)是代表官员个人还是政府。频繁的官员流动更是加大了企业与政府关系的不确定性,因为“新朝不理旧政”“人走政息”的现象较为普遍。这一切都使得中国的民营企业家面临独特的法律和政策风险。

在90年代之前,地方政府和国有企业属于“剪不断、理还乱”的关系,民营企业还面临各种政策和法律的歧视。在国有企业还比较强大的时候,许多地方政府在发展民营企业方面还多少有所顾忌,这一方面来自中央对民营企业的政策限制和意识形态的歧视,一方面担心民营经济发达之后可能会危及本地区国有企业的生存与发展,所以在一些地区曾经出现过地方政府限制和歧视民营企业发展的情形。90年代以来,地方政府与非国有企业之间的关系可以由“战略合作伙伴关系”来加以概括。这种利益共生关系首先是因为地方政府控制了地区经济中最关键性的生产要素,同时对企业经营进行各种各样的管制,民营企业必须依靠政府的支持而获得较大的发展空间。民营企业通过“寻租”和建立政治关联的方式试图获得地方政府的青睐。政治关联可能来自一些民营企业家先前在政府部门工作过的经历和资历,这些政府背景有助于民营企业家建立与政府的关联,获得一些关键性的生产要素,避免政府部门可能对民营企业采取“掠夺之手”的态度。[^20] 很难想象,一个规模较大的民营企业家与当地的政府官员没有任何关联而获得持续健康的增长。

当然,地方政府与非国有企业之间战略合作关系的形成,还有一个核心的因素,那就是地方官员的激励结构的变化。随着中国市场化改革方向日益清晰,地方官员之间围绕着经济增长和财税增长的竞争也日益激烈。非国有企业的发展对当地经济有三个基本的贡献,一是GDP的增长,二是财税的增长,三是就业的增长,这三者对于地方官员来说都是上级政绩考核的重要指标,尤其前两者所占比重最大。当民营企业和外资企业取代国有企业成为当地经济主要驱动力的时候,地方官员的晋升和财税增长都高度依赖于这些非国有企业的发展,这是90年代以来地方政府彻底改变对非国有企业的态度、形成战略性合作关系的制度基础。

地区间的激烈竞争是地方政府行为面临的新现实,地方官员由计划体制下的计划执行者变成了改革开放时期的政治企业家,为本地区的经济发展而“挖空心思”,制订适宜的产业发展战略,寻求所需的资金和政策条件,创造良好的基础设施和商业环境。地方官员如同市场中的企业家一样,必须靠创新性的战略和手段获得高于平均的政绩表现。在政治晋升和财政激励的支配下,地方政府尽一切可能整合其所能控制和影响的经济和政治资源,提高本地区的经济发展水平,而这必须依赖于地方政府与辖区内企业的密切合作。政企合作本质上是一种“双赢”的利益交换关系:地方官员提供企业发展所需要的政策和资源,企业也提供地方官员所需的政绩、利税、甚至官员个人的好处。

就地方政府向企业提供的帮助,除了行政审批、土地出让、基础设施等,最重要的就是融资和税收的支持了。在不同的历史发展阶段,地方政府为企业提供的融资服务的方式也不尽相同,大致说起来有以下几种最常见的方式:(1)在改革开放的初期,银行贷款受贷款额度的限制,地方官员帮助企业协调和争取贷款额度;(2)在银行系统脱离地方政府控制之后,地方政府出资设立信托公司,以财政资金吸引银行资金投给企业;(3)直接为企业贷款作担保,或者出资设立担保公司,帮助地方企业贷款;(4)帮助企业上市融资;(5)设立开发区,将土地批给企业,然后以土地作抵押向银行获得贷款等等。在税收方面,根据目前我国财政管理体制的基本特点,税收的开征、减免等权力全部属于中央政府,除中央政府有明确授权的减免之外,各级地方政府均无权在中央规定的范围之外乱开口子。从性质上可划分为制度减免、临时减免与其他性质减免。第三类减免主要是地方政府依照税收法律、法规赋予的权限,对纳税人实施的减免,如地方政府为招商引资实施的一些诸如“先征后返”等地方性优惠政策。但是,这一块管理相对混乱,地方违反规定擅自批缓税、擅自减免税、改变税率税基、擅自先征后返的现象屡屡发生。一些地区还出现了“空心开发区”以及企业“区内注册,区外经营”的现象(许善达等,2003)。地方政府能够向企业提供的服务还有很多,包括违规为企业服务,比如只要地方政府支持,所有的项目都可以先上马再说,征地、拆迁补偿、项目审批、项目设计和规划、环保评估等都可以手续补上。作为交换,辖区内的企业也必须为地方官员提供各式各样的收益,当然最重要的是GDP增长、就业、税收等。有时企业还必须牺牲自己的一些利益为地方官员的政治目标服务,以换取地方官员的信任和支持。

当我们经常使用政企关系来刻画地方政府和民企关系的时候,其关系的实质应该属于高度人格化的官商关系。“官场+市场”理论提供了解析这个重要问题的独特视角。因为政治锦标赛和官场竞争聚焦于人,晋升激励落实到人。地方官员的个人特征,如年龄、任期、职位,均直接关系到晋升的概率,从而影响地方官员对于辖区内经济绩效的兴趣强度,进而影响到对于辖区企业家的关心和扶持程度。企业家做大做强企业,甚至为辖区GDP的短期增长而牺牲企业的长期利益,也是对主政官个人的直接贡献。这些都是在个人意义上的互助和共赢关系,因而更清晰地体现了官商关系的特征,区别于地方政府与国企之间非人格化的政企关系。官员与民企之间这种人格化的关系进一步反映在如下两个事实上:第一,当某个地方官离任之后,新官上任,作为制度载体的地方政府没有任何改变,但因为主政官的变化,民营企业与地方政府的关系可能悄然发生了变化,甚至极为重要的变化。这里不仅仅有“新官不理旧政”的问题,还有新官的晋升激励强弱的问题。第二,当地方官去别的地区赴任时,原来与该地方官关系密切的民营企业家经常会随之到履新地投资。这里既有相互信任的问题,也有人格化的利益交换和共赢的内涵。而在中国这样一个特殊的“人治”社会,给定地方官手中的自由裁量权,官员与民企之间的人格化关系的性质进一步得到强化。

一说起官商关系,我们很容易联想到官商勾结,权钱交易,贪污腐败,确实媒体曝光了太多这方面的例子。但是,我们想强调的是,官商关系是“官场+市场”模式的必然结果,当它发挥积极作用的时候,也是通过人格化的官商关系这个媒介起作用;当它阻碍区域经济发展的时候,也莫不如此。这里我们所说的人格化,既有官员与企业家纯粹的个人特质(如人品、性格),也有“官场+市场”模式在官员和企业家及双方关系所投射的个人特征,如官员年龄和任期所影响的晋升激励在官员行为当中的体现、企业家与官员的相互支持和信任;我们更强调后者。地方官员出于晋升激励对民营企业的行政保护和政策支持本身就具有个人色彩,这种人格化的行政保护在中国法治不健全的环境下比司法保护更为有效,民营企业和外资企业也非常需要这种保护和承诺。因此,官商关系有积极、正面的时候,也有消极、腐败的时候,就像一枚硬币的两面同时存在,如影随形。当然,这种人格化的官商关系具有很大的不确定性和政治风险,我们会看到最近一些企业政商策略的核心在于打造企业和地方政府之间稳定和可预期的关系。

为了更好地理解地方官员和民营企业家之间的利益共生和双赢合作关系的性质和影响,我们下面想深入剖析一些政商关系的案例,以此揭示“官场+市场”模式如何塑造中国企业生存和发展的政商之道,推动官商关系在新的条件下“升级换代”,以及决定官商关系的复杂性质及其影响。

首先我们想讲述的案例是吉利公司的飞速发展。作为吉利公司的创始人,李书福1995年决定进入中国的汽车市场,发誓造“中华第一车”,但他的这个大胆计划让他获得了“汽车疯子”的外号。[^21] 在决定生产汽车之前,李书福主要从事摩托车和电冰箱的生产,销售业绩不错,积累了相当的个人财富,但要进入当时完全由国企和外资企业垄断的汽车行业,李书福首先面临缺技术、缺资金、缺人才的三大障碍。比如当时有人估算要建立一家汽车制造厂,至少需要5亿元人民币的初始资金,而李书福手中的资金充其量只有一个亿。作为民营企业家,李书福很难从银行获得贷款。进入汽车行业,李书福还面临另外一个致命的屏障:没有生产汽车的许可证。吉利公司最后通过并购四川德阳某监狱附属的汽配厂获得了生产的许可证。可是问题没有完全解决,这个许可证理论上只允许吉利在四川德阳生产,但吉利没有远赴德阳,而是选择在李书福的家乡浙江台州生产。异地造车按照当时的管制属于禁止的,至少是不被允许的。但吉利汽车得到了当时浙江省政府的支持,浙江省一位主管工业的副省长亲自赶到台州见证吉利第一辆汽车下线。浙江省政府扶持吉利也有其自身的考虑,浙江一直有中国非常发达的汽配产业,但苦于没有整车制造商;吉利虽然是一家刚起步的民营企业,对于民营经济高度发达的浙江来说这不是一个问题。

在地方政府的默许下,吉利“灰色”而艰难地生存着。借助中国汽车产业在90年代以来井喷式发展的大势,吉利通过定位于低端经济型轿车这个细分市场逐渐发展起来,在中国的蓬勃发展的汽车市场获得了一席之地。当全球金融海啸冲击发达国家之时,2009年吉利公司借势而为,决定收购限于财务困境的瑞典沃尔沃轿车公司。当时的收购价为18亿美元。吉利公司靠自己的力量筹集了大约10亿美元的资金,距离要完成收购仍然有8亿美元的缺口。收购之后在国内投资建厂还需大规模征地、贷款,后续运营还需5—10亿美元的资金,一系列的困难和挑战摆在了李书福前面。在这个关键的节点上,李书福再次把求助的目光投向了地方政府。李书福分别找一些直辖市和地级市政府谈合作,希望地方政府给予融资和土地的支持。他打动地方政府的杀手锏是用投资换取沃尔沃的落户生产,年产几十万辆的汽车生产基地以及由此产生的巨大的GDP、利税和就业的拉动效应。汽车产业在地方政府眼里是一个极具吸引力的战略性的产业,而沃尔沃作为世界级的汽车品牌更是光彩照人,结果引致了地方政府之间围绕着吸引沃尔沃落户生产的激烈竞争,最终吉利选择了上海嘉定、大庆、北京、成都、郑州等地进行融资和生产合作。李书福顺利得到了收购及后续投资所需的资金、土地甚至供应链配套的许诺,在2010年成功收购了沃尔沃。[^22] 这场跨国并购被媒体喻为“穷小子与公主的婚姻”,在正常情况下是不可能的,李书福以他独有的商业眼光、魄力和政治智慧做了看似不可能完成的事情。吉利公司作为草根的民营企业,在中国这样一个高度管制的汽车行业的逆袭成功,其实讲述的是中国民间旺盛的企业家精神在国家管制的狭缝中如何借力追求政绩的地方官员顽强成长的故事。

中国独有的官场与市场互动格局让一些企业家将产品创新和商业盈利模式牢固地建立在政商关系之上。[^23] 这里我们分析两个企业的案例,一个是万达集团,一个是华夏幸福基业,代表了房地产企业两种升级转型的样板。万达集团早年是大连的一家房地产企业,1987年成立,主要从事住宅的开发,2000年把总部迁入北京,开始转向商业地产。近年来万达集团进入文化旅游产业,2012年斥资26亿美元收购美国第二大院线公司AMC。万达集团在地产行业最早推出了其标志性的产品——万达广场,后来陆续推出城市综合体、大型文化旅游项目(如长白山国际旅游基地、楚河汉街)及国际影城。万达广场是一个集购物中心、娱乐、餐饮、酒店于一体的商业地产项目,采取订单式招商模式,通过吸引像沃尔玛、百胜这样的大型零售企业率先入驻,提升万达广场的人气,从而吸引大量的小型商户入驻。截至2012年底,万达广场已经在国内70多个城市落户,成为地方官员极力追逐的商业地产项目,万达集团能够从地方政府那里拿到比较廉价的土地和融资的协助。据万达集团董事长王健林介绍,每年都有100多个市长找他,希望吸引万达前去投资。

为什么万达广场如此受到地方官员的追捧?大致有如下几个原因:首先,万达广场能改变一座城市的功能和结构,打造城市新名片,提高城市知名度,这是地方官员所追求的效果。其次,万达广场是官员政绩的孵化器。万达广场作为商业地产项目与简单的住宅开发不同,后者只能带来一次性的土地出让收入和相关的税费收入,而前者却能带来持续的产值、就业和税收。按照万达的说法,一座万达广场可以创造成上亿元的税收和1万人的就业。更关键的是,万达广场可能选择一个城市比较偏僻的地域,但一旦建成之后,加上相关的配套的酒店和服务设施,一个城市新中心呼之欲出,周边土地的价格迅速攀升。其次,万达集团承诺万达广场从开工到开业要在18个月完成,这被万达集团内部像军事命令一样加以执行。18个月是个精心设计的数字,因为地级市官员的任期一般是3年左右,18个月一般可以保证在地方官员的正常任期竣工,让其在任内享受到政绩。从这个意义上说,万达广场是为地方官员的特殊偏好量身定做的地产项目,万达集团为当地招商,抬升地价,创造产值、税收和就业,而且还保证所有这一切都在地方官员的任期内实现,正是所谓“想政府之所想,急政府之所急”。万达集团进入旅游和文化产业之后,项目规模进一步加大。2009年开工的楚河汉街就耗资500亿元,因为和中央强调的做大文化产业的政策导向合拍,更是让地方官员心动不已。据王健林说,自此万达做文化旅游项目之后,找他的地方领导已不再是市长而是省长了。

万达广场通过推出让地方官员心仪的地产项目,获得了地方政府鼎力支持,从征地、批地、施工到土地价格和融资,“无微不至”。王健林非常直白地点出了万达的政商之道的核心:“万达不断创新产品,目的就是要让地方官员追逐万达,而不是万达追逐官员,从而处于政商关系的主动地位”。我们可以从万达的商业模式中清晰地看出中国特有的政商之道。

如果说万达是以政商合作为基础打造了商业地产的盈利模式,那么幸福华夏基业就是以政商合作为基础打造了产业地产的商业模式,从政商关系的角度看是一次升级转型。幸福华夏创立于1998年,早期从事房地产。2002年转入产业地产,与固安县政府合作建立固安工业园,投资开发运营产业新城。固安工业园地处河北廊坊,距离天安门正南50公里,2006年正式批准为省级工业园。2002年当华夏幸福投资固安之时,固安财政收入才9000万元,位于廊坊下辖区县的末尾。截至2014年,华夏幸福在固安已经累计引入签约项目482个,投资额达638亿元。2014年固安县财政收入跃升40亿,增长30倍,经济指标从廊坊末位升至前列,固安工业园2015年被国家发改委列为新型城镇化样板。

固安工业园区是幸福华夏打造的第一个产业地产的样板,“产城融合,整体开发,政商共赢”是其基本模式的主要特点,具体说来包含以下几个方面:第一,政企合作:华夏从固安县政府获得园区排他性特许经营权,与政府达成50年的长期合作协议;这保证了幸福华夏长期投资收益的安全性,同时投资收益不外溢。第二,华夏的准政府身份:华夏与政府联合组成园区管委会,开发和运营整个园区。华夏负责工业园的整体开发,负责基础设施和相关公共设施的投资、建设、开发、运营,提供公共产品和社会化服务,华夏垫付初期资金投入。2006年至今华夏幸福累计投入160亿。第三,收益回报和风险分担:政府从固安工业园区新增的财政收入中支付费用,项目建成后按照建设成本加价10%支付工程款,公司垫付2—3年。政府不承担经营风险,也不形成负债,这是吸引地方政府的一大特点。[^24]

为吸引龙头企业、产业链高端项目,华夏幸福确保基础设施和城市配套建设适度超前。招商和产业集聚是固安工业园区模式的基石,围绕汽车零部件、现代装备、电子信息等主导产业形成产业集聚,以城镇化为依托,以产业为核心,以产带城,以城促产,实现从单一的制造型园区向多功能制造、服务、消费城市型经济转型。本质上,华夏幸福打造了一个“产业新城+X”的平台型模式,即以产业新城为平台,接入地产开发、产业投资与运营、教育培训、医疗健康及商贸物流服务等多元化配套业务。

华夏幸福2011年上市,截至2016年5月份公司资产规模达到1860亿。从河北固安工业园开始,目前已布局于全国30余个区域,2016完成150个产业园。北京、河北、上海、辽宁、江苏、浙江、四川、安徽等地,截至 2015 年底,各产业园累计引进签约企业约 900 家,招商引资额2200亿元,创造新增就业岗位近4 万个。[^25]

在一些地区,地方政府与一些大型民企形成“荣辱与共”“唇齿相依”的关系。2007年4月7日河南华林塑料集团及下属4家子公司被法院宣布进入破产程序。该集团原董事长孙树华2004年跻身《福布斯》中国富豪榜第138位,为河南首富。他以提供虚假财务报表、重复抵押土地的方式从多家金融机构取得贷款13.6亿元。进入破产程序前,华林高达19.3亿元的负债总额中就有超过13亿元是银行贷款。孙树华从小本生意起家,于2001年成立华林集团。孙树华曾是河南省十届人大代表、淮阳县政协副主席。华林集团在财务、办公、营销等方面的规章制度及法人治理结构相当混乱,基本上是孙及其在企业的家族成员说了算。华林的第一次危机发生在2004年6月,当交通银行郑州银行要求华林归还即将到期的1.9亿元贷款。为了协助华林集团渡过难关,当地政府协调财政局和淮阳县第一中学向华林集团转借6000万元资金。2005年2月,河南省银监局发出针对华林集团的风险提示,提醒省内各家银行注意。上海一家媒体称,华林集团各项贷款总额一度高达48亿元,远远超过了其资产总额。面对金融界和媒体的质疑,周口市当时的市委书记在大会上表态说:“华林是我们周口最大的企业之一,我们周口与淮阳要与华林共存亡!”河南省银监局公告事件不久,河南省、周口市相关领导先后到华林集团考察,将这场媒体风波形容为“竞争对手的点火”和“媒体的炒作”。为了挽救华林集团,河南省政府办公厅2006年2月下发一份文件,建议华林的债权银行不要单独起诉、冻结资产,并希望省内银行为华林集团提供封闭贷款以助其渡过难关。华林集团获得了短暂的喘息的机会,通过此举其贷款额从最高峰的40多亿减少到警方认定的13.6亿元。[^26]

近几年发生的江西省市两级政府联合救助深陷困境中的赛维LDK也反映了地方政府和民营企业之间深度的利益捆绑。赛维LDK在短短几年的时间制造了中国光伏产业的一个传奇故事,然而好景不长,欧美的反制措施让赛维盛极而衰,迅速陷入经营困境。在这个过程中,最引人注目的方面是赛维与背后的地方政府之间的坚强的同盟关系。

赛维的创始人彭小峰做劳保用品起家,在外贸行业耕耘多年。2004年,基于对光伏产业发展前景的乐观判断,彭小峰决定进军光伏产业。虽然抱有宏大的产业梦想,但苦于手中缺乏资金。一个偶然的机会,彭小峰接触到江西省新余市的领导,谈起关于光伏产业的想法,结果双方一拍即合。新余市利用多年的财政结余加上银行贷款2亿元支持彭小峰购买关键性技术和设备,彭小峰2005年创立了赛维,并把赛维的总部设在了新余市。时任新余市市长的汪德和事后回忆双方的这段合作经历,坦言“当时是用自己的政治生命压赌”。[^27] 地方政府的“雪中送炭”确实成就了一个草根企业家的产业梦想,而赛维进军光伏产业也让中部地区一个苦于找不到经济跳跃机会的地方官员可以放手一搏,所以赛维落户新余见证了一个市场企业家与政治企业家的真诚合作与大胆冒险。

2007年在纽交所上市,彭小峰当时身价400亿,曾经名列中国首富。赛维利用资本市场的融资以及地方政府的支持全产业链扩张,迅速成为全球最大的太阳能电池封装生产商。新余市也因此成为中国光伏产业发展的一个重要基地,拥有美国纳斯达克上市企业和国际知名品牌,荣获国家科技部颁发的全国第一块新能源基地的称号,新余市一跃成为江西省人均财政收入最高的地级市。新余市政府的早期努力和冒险确实获得了巨额的经济和政治回报。

2005年以来赛维与新余市政府荣辱与共,休戚相关。如何为赛维提供服务成为地方官员工作汇报的重要内容,地方官员为赛维提供了全天候保姆式服务,土地、融资、税收优惠、补贴等等方面的政策和服务一应俱全。到2011年底,围线在赛维身边的上下游光伏企业近百家,产值超200亿元。新余市统计局的数据显示,正是受益于光伏产业的迅猛增长,2011年新余市新能源的产值达421.67亿元。2008年,赛维上缴利税2.8亿元,并创造了16000多个就业岗位。到2011年,仅赛维一家企业,即上缴税收13.6亿元,成为新余市财政贡献第一大户。同时,赛维创造了20000多个工作岗位。2011年底,围线在赛维身边的上下游光伏企业近百家,产值超200亿元。而在赛维进入之前,钢铁业一直是新余市的支柱产业,财政贡献率最大、就业安置人数最多。这个当时财政总收入只有18亿元、可支配财力不过几亿元的“钢城”小市,到2011年的财政总收入达111.3亿元,一跃成为江西的经济强市。以赛维为“龙头”的光伏产业已占据新余工业经济的半壁江山。赛维在江西省政府看来也是一块金字招牌,颇受当时省委省政府领导的青睐,被江西省政府列为要实现的三个千亿工程之一,在“十二五”规划中也明确提出要支持赛维成为千亿企业。[^28]

2011年欧美国家对原产于中国的晶硅光伏电池做出反倾销和反补贴诉讼,大幅提高进口关税,给予中国光伏企业致命一击。主要面向欧美市场的中国光伏企业失去了大部分的海外市场,导致产能严重过剩,而之前快速扩张形成的高负债率在现金流大幅减少的情况下已经难以为继。2012年陷入困境的赛维LDK面临资金链断裂的危险,对此地方政府迅速做出了反应。江西省政府2012年5月筹措20亿元成立“赛维稳定基金”。2012年6月29日,赛维LDK三年前向华融国际信托有限责任公司(以下简称华融信托)办理的一笔5亿元的债务到期。赛维LDK希望再向华融信托受理一笔5亿元的信托业务,但此次,华融信托开出的条件是,新余市政府必须出具经市人大常委会审议通过的将该贷款还款计划列入财政预算的相关文件。最终,新余市人大常委会会议审议通过了上述议案。新余市政府2012年7月宣布准备启用财政资金为赛维LDK5亿元信托贷款兜底。用纳税人的钱,以人大议案的方式,给一个民营企业家的债务兜底,此消息一出,立刻引发社会一片哗然。

政府的救助未能奏效,陷入绝境的赛维最后不得不停产、退市,进入债务重组。截至2013年9月30日,赛维总负债为48亿美元,负债率在100%以上。即便在赛维已经山穷水尽的情况下,新余政府仍然“不离不弃”,一直在寻求拯救赛维的良机。2014年5月,赛维获得了“救命稻草”,国开行牵头11家银行组成的银团给予了赛维20亿元贷款。两个月之后,停产两年多的马洪硅料厂宣布复工。在新余市政府的支持下,赛维的债务重组方案进展顺利,有望摆脱困局。[^29]

地方政府与民营企业的深度利益捆绑,尤其在大型民营企业陷于困境时地方政府鼎力相助,绝不仅仅是上面提到的两个例子,在中国其实变成了比较普遍的情况。比如最近山西省三级地方政府联合救助海鑫钢铁集团[^30] ,也是类似性质的事件。虽然这和计划经济时期政府对国有企业基于“父爱主义”的软预算约束在内涵上有差异,但从企业陷入困境之后地方政府救助的方式和力度上是相似的,也是预算软约束的一种体现,只是地方政府对企业的干预是基于政绩竞赛、税收和社会稳定的需要,救助对象超越了所有制的联系。

当然,“官场+市场”所蕴育的政商之道并不总是双赢的结果,政府在政商关系中的强势地位经常让相对弱势的企业成为地方官员追求成绩的牺牲品。这里我们讨论中国巨型家电企业长虹的案例,长虹在2003年爆出美国公司的巨额欠债案。据长虹2003年年度报告,截至2003年末,公司应收账款49.85亿元人民币,其中美国APEX公司的应收账款为44.46亿元。事实上,长虹与APEX的合作,一度让外界产生的最大的疑问,就是倪润峰为什么以如此激烈的方式、冒着相当的风险去开发美国市场。有业内人士表示,将长虹在美国失利的责任全部归咎于它的掌门人倪润峰并不公允。据透露,在倪润峰第一次退出之后,继任者赵勇大力压缩库存,取得显著成效,但却使长虹销售收入下滑,并连累四川省的GDP指标大幅下降。这是倪润峰重新出山的关键因素。而在倪重新出山之后,四川省不止一位主要领导前往长虹,希望长虹在四川省经济发展中发挥重要作用。倪润峰就是为了支持省政府完成GDP指标,在巨大压力之下,才孤注一掷去美国开辟市场,从而忽略了利润指标和资金的回笼,最终导致APEX巨额欠款案的发生,使自己陷入进退两难的境地。[^31]

我们前面曾经强调地方政府与国企之间的关系性质更接近于制度化和非人格化,这在计划经济时期尤其如此,因为两者关系的基础是产权和上下级权力关系,基于“父爱主义”的软预算约束就是这种非人格化关系的具体体现。但是,当地方官员为锦标赛竞争而奋斗的时候,国企领导与地方官员之间的关系也开始具有某些人格化的色彩了。上述长虹案例恰好说明了这一点,四川地方官员的政绩诉求导致了倪润峰的重新出山,双方桃李相报已经属于个人层面的交换了,由此带来的规模过度扩张及后来的政府救助在结果上就是预算软约束行为,但与传统的基于“父爱主义”的软预算约束显然是不一样的性质。

以GDP为核心的政治锦标赛以及层层分包体制塑造了地方官员的核心利益(如产值、税收、就业和维稳)。如果企业家能够为官员的核心利益作出重要贡献,地方官员会慷慨解囊,倾力相助,吉利、赛维的故事是这方面最好的诠释。反过来说,企业家的决策和行为一旦伤害到地方官员的核心利益,触及政商关系的底线,那么地方官员将可能会动用其资源和权力进行反击。

在李书福发誓“造中华第一车”之前,仰融是中国汽车产业引来的第一个非国有的搅局者。作为资本市场上曾经翻云覆雨的操盘手,仰融在上世纪90年代初迷上了汽车制造,1992年收购沈阳金杯汽车厂,组建“华晨中国汽车”,并在纽约成功上市,成为中国企业在美国资本市场上市的先驱者。经过多年的苦心经营,到2001年前后,仰融的华晨系旗下有5家上市公司,市值高达246亿元。在汽车制造方面拥有8条汽车生产线,10多家汽车整车和部件工厂,一年的利润仅次于上海大众、一汽大众,俨然是中国汽车产业的希望之星。仰融命运的转折发生在2001年初,他与英国著名的百年汽车品牌罗孚谈合作,计划合资后罗孚的所有产品都搬到中国生产,且有意把生产基地选在杭州。这本属于企业的商业决策,与政府无关。但是在中国特殊的政经环境下,如此看好的项目迁到杭州,被辽宁省和沈阳市政府解读为“肥水流入外人田”,断然不能接受。双方进行了反复磋商,政府方面希望仰融把罗孚项目放在辽宁,省政府甚至做出妥协,提出一个“大连”方案,然而,仰融执意要在杭州建厂。这导致政府方面强烈反弹,最后是财政部下文,将华晨及其派生的所有公司一次性划转辽宁省人民政府,而仰融只好出走美国。[^32]

地方官员与企业家的利益交换可以在一种合规、正面和积极的政企关系中进行运作,但是,在很多场合,两者关系的尺度并不容易精准把握,政商之间的正规合作关系经常容易演变成官商勾结和权钱交易关系。企业家与一些政府官员进行深度的利益捆绑,甚至还可能形成人身依附关系,而地方官员则利用企业家谋取不正当的经济利益。

近年来一些走向畸形的政商关系出现了某些新的特征和趋势,地方官员和企业之间不仅仅是单纯的权钱交易,而是一些企业主动为地方官员输送政绩,为地方官员谋求更大的晋升空间,以此获得未来长期的利益回报。这里政商之间也许不直接涉及权钱交易,但各取所需,隐性交易,不易被外人察觉,甚至找不出有何差错。[^33]

最近各地曝光较多的“官媒勾结”现象则又从另一个侧面反映了地方官员如何从地方经济中获取权力租金。这些利益关联使得中央的政策与监管措施无法得以实施,从而奠定了中央与地方利益博弈的经济利益基础。这与传统计划经济时期中央和地方利益博弈的性质有了很大的不同。

## 8.5 政商环境的地区差异：理论假说及其证据

我们前面讨论地方官员的激励、政企关系等问题,有一个隐含的假定,即所有的地方官员的激励是均质的,不存在个体差异。当然,这个假定有助于简化我们的分析,把视角放在地方官员的“平均”行为上。在现实中,不仅地方官员个体之间存在明显的差异[^34] ,而且地区之间政商环境也存在系统的差异。比如一个商人想到东南沿海地区和到东北地区投资建厂,这两地的政商环境一定有显著的差别。媒体经常报道,在中国发达地区非常成功的招商引资政策到了一些落后地区就变成了“开门引客,关门打狗”的招商策略。为什么在同一个国家,相同的文化、法律和制度,不同地区的政府对待民营企业的态度和服务水平却会存在如此明显的差异。如何解释这种差异?进一步说,为什么在经济发达地区,地方政府更可能表现为“帮助之手”,而在一些经济落后地区,地方政府经常表现为“掠夺之手”?

讨论这个问题其实非常重要。我们知道,地方经济的发展离不开地方政府高效的公共服务和良好的政商环境,而如果政府公共服务的质量又取决于当地经济发展的状况,那么由此推理下去,我们就不难得出“穷者愈穷、富者愈富”的结论,换句话说,国富国穷是一个系统性的现象。这看上去是一个悲观的结论。

要解释国富国穷的原因绝非易事,不过这不是我们这里的任务。我们这里试图提出一个相对简单的理论假说,来解释中国地区间政商环境的系统差异。[^35] 理论假说的基本逻辑如下:在经济落后的地区,由于居民收入水平低,工商企业的数量相对较少,而一些主要国有企业因体制原因经营绩效不甚理想。这就会产生两个结果:一个结果是,由于工商企业提供的就业机会很少,在当地人们就业最好的选择就去是政府机关,因为政府机关收入有保障,“旱涝保收”,工作轻松稳定。于是有关系和门路的人就千方百计想安排到政府部门工作,最终使得政府部门人员严重超编,人满为患。有证据表明在许多政府机构超编比例非常之高,尤其在经济落后地区。由于财政拨款是根据正式编制确定的,超编人员不在正式编制内,就需要单位自己从预算外的“小金库”想办法解决。而行政部门“小金库”的重要来源之一就是各种行政性收费和罚款,这是养活政府冗员的主要财政基础。当政府部门面临巨大的“养家糊口”的刚性压力时,一切可以收费和罚款的机会都会显得“机不可失,时不再来”,而很难产生发达地区“藏富于民”的心态。

另一个结果是,在经济落后地区,由于工商企业数量少,给定同等规模的收费,每个企业必须分担的政府“搜刮”费用相对就比较大,其后果就相对严重。况且在落后地区,如上所述,由于政府部门超编严重,收费和罚款的动机非常强烈,尤其使得企业不堪重负,经营成本上升,难以维持运转,这可能使得能够生存下来的工商企业数量进一步减少,外资也不敢进入,进一步加剧营商环境的恶化。

一个地区的官员腐败与该地区的官员流动性有一定关联。按照现在以经济指标为主的政治锦标赛模式,经济发展快的地区可能导致更畅通的官员流动性,而落后地区因晋升机会少而出现官路拥堵,这可能影响到地方官员的仕途预期和腐败动机。如我们在第5章所讨论的那样,当人们发现官员腐败存在著名的“59岁”现象的同时,在一些相对落后的地区,人们也开始发现腐败的“35岁”现象,这显然和官路的通畅程度有关。这说明一个官员的腐败动机与整个地区的经济发展和官路通畅程度可能存在内在的联系。

根据上面的论述,一个政府与当地企业的恶性循环由此形成:经济落后导致工商业不发达,就业机会少,政府部门的吸引力增加,人们在职业选择上更倾向去政府部门,使得政府冗员增加;而政府人员超编又导致“养人”难,必须开拓预算外财源,各种行政性收费和罚款增加,致使企业负担过重,经营效率下降,投资激励不足。而经济发达地区正好启动了一个良性循环:工商企业数目多,在企业部门的就业机会就多,收入水平就相对高,这都降低了政府部门在劳动力市场上的比较优势。于是人们更多地流向了企业部门,政府机构的规模相对变小了。政府部门因冗员压力小,对额外的收费和罚款的需求下降,而相对较多的工商企业又使得政府收费可以更加均匀地分担,不至于变成一种每个无法承受的成本负担,这无形中增加了该地区投资环境的吸引力,外地资本愿意流入。

上述理论假说虽然简单,却可以解释一系列系统的现象:第一,在越是发达的地区,人们对做官的兴趣就越低,比如在广东和浙江就一直流传有这种说法,没本事的人才去做官;而在经济落后地区,在政府做官被认为是一种莫大的荣耀,人们挤破头都想钻进去。有报道云,中国某些贫困县的副县长和县长助理加起来有二十几个之多!在发达地区这种情况是不可能发生的。第二,政府的相对规模在落后地区要更大一些。Zhang(2006)利用中国1993年和2000年2000多个县级地区的数据发现,内陆地区相对于沿海地区而言,人均的行政管理费用要高出近30%,每一百人的政府雇员人数也要多出10%。当然这些数据还只是统计编制内的政府雇员,编制外的冗员没有包括进去,如果包含进去,两种地区的差距会更大。第三,越是落后的地区越依赖于预算外收入和对于企业的各种额外的收费罚款。关于落后地区预算外收入比例相对较高这一点已经在第6章第4节里给出了支持性的证据(见图6.1)。前面提到媒体报道的关于中西部一些地区“开门引客、关门打狗”的招商政策其实也是这个问题的一个极端表现。

世界银行在中国120个城市针对企业经商环境做了一个大型的调查研究,为我们上述假说提供了更进一步的证据(World Bank,2006)。这份研究报告发现,税费占企业销售额的比重在东南地区是4.1%,渤海地区4.5%,中部地区5%,东北地区5.4%,西南地区6.3%,西北地区5.8%。而用在接待政府官员的费用占销售额的比例在东南地区是1%,渤海地区0.9%,中部地区1.2%,东北地区1.4%,西南地区1.2%,西北地区1.3%,这说明落后地区的企业更可能面临政府的“苛捐杂税”。企业每年平均与政府打交道的时间(天数)在东南地区是52,渤海地区72,中部地区52,东北地区63,西南地区66,西北地区78。

那么,这种恶性循环如何打破?关键的问题是,从一种相对落后的状态开始,地区的经济起飞如何实现?在中国改革开放30多年内,一些在计划时期原本并不十分发达的地区(如广东、浙江、江苏)借助改革开放迅速崛起,从我们的上述理论出发,它们一定在某些方面打破了政企关系的恶性循环。对于广东来说,经济特区成为一种保护投资激励的政策特区,而特殊的优惠外资和鼓励出口的政策,吸引了大批的外资尤其是港澳台资金的大量涌入,外资的涌入和大量新企业的建立在较短时间内打破了政商之间的恶性循环关系。浙江的温州地区处于前线位置,国家投资很少,经济长期落后。但这些地区在历史上就有悠久的经商传统,即使在计划经济体制时期,就大量人员在外经商,政府部门的吸引力相对较小,而且改革开放早期在外地经商的十万温州人为温州后来的产业打造了一个巨大的销售网络。事实上,在温州,许多乡镇干部和城市干部利用下班之后和公休时间经营自己的企业。江苏省在70年代初就悄悄发展社队企业,到80年代更是大力推进,而乡镇企业其实是基层政府直接参与经营的企业形式,政商合一使得政府的攫取动机大为下降(Che and Qian,1998),无形中对企业形成了产权保护。江苏集体农村企业的成功经验在中国其他地区并不能够轻易复制,因为农村集体企业要求乡镇干部的强势地位和良好的经营素质,而这正是江苏许多地区的历史禀赋所赐予的。像无锡地区1949年以后国家的农业税赋一直非常沉重,必须依靠乡镇集体领导对农业生产的有效管理,由此造就了一个发达的集体经济和一支高素质的基层干部队伍。

这些例子的有益启示是,打破政商恶性循环的重要来源可以是以下几个方面:第一,在政策特区的鼓励下资本的“大推进式”的流入;有时干部异地交流可以从发达地区带去一些关联企业到落后地区投资,带动当地经济发展。第二,人员的大量迁出或被吸引到政府之外的职业,从这个意义上说,取消户籍制度、便利人员自由流动非常重要;第三,地方政府直接参与经营,但这种模式的成效必须依赖相应的制度和干部条件保证其经营效率。

# 9 当行政发包制遇上政治锦标赛

新权威主义的代表人物萧功秦先生认为,中国改革开放所经历的高速经济增长得益于中国传统的动员型威权体制,得益于对传统行政体制优势的发挥(萧功秦,2008)。具体地说,邓小平时代继承了毛泽东时期全能主义体制强大的组织资源与政治资源,并运用这一政治资源推动市场化改革和实现政治稳定。可是,从推动市场化改革和经济增长来说,传统行政体制的优势究竟体现在哪些方面?这些优势是由怎样的体制结构支撑的呢?中国动员型体制的优势经常与“举国体制”“集中力量办大事”联系起来。我们确实看到了“集中力量办大事”的优越之处,比如我国航天工程、国防工业的飞速发展,但与此同时,我们也看到,许多老百姓关心的问题,如食品安全、环境保护、教育医疗问题,一直在困扰着我们。为什么中国可以通过“举国体制”解决“两弹一星”、神十上天问题,却对于食品安全、煤矿安全生产、环境治理等类似问题如此束手无策?

在本章,我们试图结合前面各章节的内容,提出一个理解中国官员激励和政府治理的分析框架,揭示中国独特的行政体制所蕴含的灵活性、动员能力和潜在的问题。概而言之,行政发包与政治锦标赛构成中国传统行政治理体制的两个基本维度,体现了纵向行政发包和横向官场竞争的高度统一。解析这两个维度及其互动是我们理解中国官员激励与政府治理、动员型社会以及国家治理能力的出发点。

## 9.1 纵向发包和横向竞争

如前所述,中国行政发包制的特征是属地层层发包,而在同一行政级别的地方主政官之间又存在晋升竞争,即“锦标赛”竞争或官场竞争;所以中国行政体制是层层“纵向发包”与“横向竞争”的有机结合体。“纵向发包”与“横向竞争”的结合为我们构造了一个理解中国政府治理模式的分析框架。

经过行政逐级属地发包,中国的地方政府成为全能型或全权型政府[^1] ,即他们所拥有的权力是无所不包的,从行政、司法到社会治安、经济发展等方方面面。在西方发达国家,如美国,司法权、行政权和立法权是相对独立的,而在中国,除了立法权之外,这些权力、连同其他相关权力统统“打包”给了地方政府。长期以来,司法体系的地方化倾向非常严重,司法、检察机关的人财物受地方政府控制,其主要领导的任命权在同级地方政府。在一些发达地区,招商引资活动通常是由地方的党政一把手携同政府的“四大班子”以及公检法的领导组成强大阵容,与外资企业协商谈判,给予外商各种可能的优惠政策,包括软环境(司法和治安)的支持。这在一个侧面反映了地方政府权力的广泛性和一元性,在发达地区被整合起来用来提供外商投资所需的政策、司法和社会环境。

从政府部门权力的设置来看,一元化领导是其重要特点,全能型的政府权力和一元化的权力结构最为清晰地表明了这样一个基本事实:地方政府是上级政府发包的所有行政事务的总承包方和第一行政责任人。首先,上级政府发包的是所有政府事务,因而下级政府的权力也是“统统打包”之后授予的,这是它的全能型特征。事实上,在管理的事务上和拥有的权力方面,地方政府基本上成为上级政府的“微缩版”。用现代的术语表示,我们国家的不同层级的政府之间在职能上是高度同构和重叠的。其次,为了突出总承包方的行政责任,确定地方行政首脑是总承包方和第一责任人的身份,所有打包下放的权力最终要集中于一个人。这个人必须对所有的承包任务负全部和最终的责任,为此,上级政府必须给予地方行政首脑统摄全局的权力。

在中国传统的行政发包体制中,属地管理是一个历史悠久的治理特征。它的核心在于让每个人都归属于他(她)被管辖的地域,而任何跨地域的联系必须以管辖政府为中介才可能发生。一个人或机构与其属地的关系是全面的,自给自足的,就像一个村民与其所在的村庄的关系,一个社员与人民公社的关系,以及一个职员与其单位的关系。以这些属地关系为基础,行政领导对于其下属成员的行为具有超强的控制力和影响力,因为后者不能轻易摆脱属地关系,一旦离开,或属地关系被解除,其身份就不好界定了,生存问题也会随之冒出来。新中国建立之后,在计划经济时期,个人生活和工作的方方面面都离不开单位组织,形成对组织的严重依赖。属地管理要求每个人都属于其辖区,而且各属地之间也是被分割的,属地之间的横向联系不被鼓励,不属于任何辖区的“流民”要加以限制。从上级政府的角度看,属地管理的好处在于容易界定行政责任人,落实“谁主管,谁负责”的原则。虽然中国政府层级多,幅员广阔,人口规模大,中央要动员任何一个人相对来说是比较容易的,只需从省级政府开始,从省到市再到县乡,逐级动员,可以迅速动员到个人,责任也可以迅速落实到个人。这就是人们通常说的中国行政体制特殊的动员能力。

中国的属地管理原则的优点在国家遇上的严重的自然灾害的时候体现得最为明显。这里有两个例子可以很好地说明中国行政体制如何利用属地管理的原则来抵御和战胜重大自然灾害。第一个例子是2003年的非典疫情的爆发。非典疫情出现以后,中国很快成立了一个全国性的非典疫情信息报告中心,及时掌握每一时点上全国各地的非典疫情的发生和发展情况,实现了信息的第一时间的汇集和播报。最关键的是应对机制是,对于疫情的监控责任可以按照属地原则层层落实到每一个行政区和企事业单位,通过每一个微观单位对个人的疫情监控来控制非典的流行。第二个例子是汶川大地震。为了举全国之力抗击地震灾害,重建家园,一方面中央紧急组成抗震救灾总指挥部,调动解放军和武警官兵深入抢险救灾的第一线,下拨大量的财政资金,紧急运送救灾物资,另一方面是号召全国各地发挥“一方有难,八方支援”的精神,鼓励各省区市竭尽全力支援灾区。于是来自全国各个省市自治区的救援队、医疗队分赴灾区,全力参与搜救被困群众,救治伤员,防控疫情,抢修基础设施,来自全国各地的大批救灾物资也先后运抵灾区。除此之外,中央还建立了正式的对口支援灾区的制度,按照“一省帮一重灾县”的原则,组织有关省市对口支援灾区,提供受灾群众的临时住所,解决灾区群众的基本生活,协助灾区恢复重建,协助灾区恢复和发展经济,提供经济合作和技术指导。北京等21个省市分别对口支持四川省的一个重灾县,如上海对口支援都江堰市,山东支援北川县,广东支援汶川县等。民政部对甘肃和陕西灾区的对口支援也做出了安排和部署,确定北京、天津对口支援四川重灾县的同时,北京还要对口支援陇南市,天津对口支援甘南市。对口支援其实就是以属地包干的形式解决灾后重建所需的人、财、物的分摊和责任落实问题。在应对新中国成立以来最大的地震灾害的过程中,在中央的统一指挥和部署下,以属地和对口支援为特征组织抢险救援和灾后重建发挥了极为关键的作用,体现了中国行政体制中“集中力量办大事”的优势。[^2] 世界上其他国家的救灾行动看不见这种情形。比如美国卡特里娜飓风灾害发生之后的救援行动在政府方面主要是联邦政府和佛罗里达州政府的事情,加上国际红十字会等一些慈善组织的协助,并没有看到别的州有组织的援助行动。中国政府对四川特大地震灾害的及时反应和全国范围内的迅速动员与美国政府在2005年的卡特里娜飓风灾害的应对和表现形成鲜明对比,国内外媒体都不约而同地把两者进行了比较。美国联邦政府在飓风灾害发生之后的第7天才进入灾区,州政府在救灾方面也缺乏强有力的组织和部署。

新中国成立之后,属地管理原则还有一些重要发展。一是行政隶属关系的出现,比如企事业单位,到底是隶属中央,还是隶属地方政府;或者归口管理,上级主管部门是谁,每一个组织或机构都必须归口管理,或者挂靠某个机构,代为管理。在原则上,行政隶属关系与属地关系是高度一致的,可以看作是属地管理的自然延伸和发展。二是在条块管理中的属地关系对条条部门的制约,比如在条条部门的序列之下上级部门对下级部门有业务指导之责,但同级地方政府对该部门有人、财、物的支配权。即使当条条部门属于中央垂直管理或省内垂直管理,其党群关系还放在同级地方政府,受到后者的制约。

中国传统的行政发包制的一个极为关键的维度是政府间的财政分成制。长久以来,中国不同政府层级之间财政关系主要是围绕着财力的分配进行,很少涉及事权的分配和调整。从古到今,各级地方政府的事权根据行政逐级发包的原则进行分配,而行政发包体制的延续性使得政府间的事权分配一直保持惊人的稳定性。在财力分配过程中,上级政府的财政需要必须首先确保,然后才是下级政府的财政需要如何满足的问题。也就是说,满足上级政府的财政需要是下级政府的刚性义务,这反映了不同政府层级行政权力分配的不对称性。这也是我们强调行政发包关系是发生在政府内部的原因。

在古代,我们经常看到财政包干制的流行:地方政府每年向朝廷上缴一个相对固定的税赋,剩下的才是地方留成部分,用于支付最基本的行政费用和官员的薪俸。但这些留成部分非常有限,往往入不敷出,很多正常行政支出(包括州县官雇佣幕友、衙役等政府人员的工资)还必须靠额外的杂税和税收附加来满足。当然地方官员的灰色收入也从这些苛捐杂税中抽取。在本质上,朝廷和地方基层政府有一个隐性的财政包干合约:地方必须确保每年上缴朝廷的税赋额度,至于地方财政支出的经费来源(包括地方官员的薪水)一部分靠正式的财政留成,一部分靠自筹;不管地方官员如何筹集额外的经费来源——那属于各人“八仙过海,各显神通”的部分,前提是不许官逼民反,否则拿地方官是问。这里的财政包干体现在两个方面:一是上缴部分的包干,“包死基数”;除此之外就是地方政府的;二是地方政府支出的包干,即根据各地具体情况核定的行政费用是固定的,用财政收入留成部分加以支持,类似于新中国建立初期的“支出包干”,包干之外如有不足(其实远远不够),则自己想办法补足。这种财政包干制的突出优点在于节省了上级政府对财政过程的控制和监督成本,确定了政府层级之间的财力分配,更重要的是,赋予了地方基层政府组织财政收入的激励。

新中国成立之后,即使在高度集权的计划体制下,大规模集中建设和计划经济的运行需要中央集中大量的财力,正如我们在第4章所论述的那样,中央和地方的财政关系仍然局部体现了财政包干制的一些特点。1958年之后各种形式的“支出包干”“自收自支”的安排经常出现。70年代后期江苏省就在试点财政包干制。80年代初期开始至1994年中国财政体制进入了一个较为彻底的“财政包干制”的时代,这是大家所熟知的。即使在“分税制”时代,中央和地方仍然是在维持过去的事权分配的基础上实现对不同税种收入的分享,其改革的重要目的之一是遏制中央财政收入比重持续下降的势头,重新调整和确定中央和地方的财力分配,与此同时,还要赋予地方征收和创造财政收入的必要激励。预算外资金和非预算资金与财政包干制和分税制长期共存,一直扮演着在体制外补偿地方政府预算内收入不足的角色。

中国传统的财政体制典型属于“激励型”财政,即它组织设计的一个核心问题是在确保中央获上级政府的财政需要的前提下如何激励地方政府创造收入满足其自身的财政需要。这也许可以解释为什么从古至今中国政府间的财政关系中财政包干制的因素总是存在,只是形式有所不同而已。从经济学的角度看,包干制相对于雇佣制[^3] 来说是一种典型的强激励(high-powered)的合约形式。在这种强激励的制度之下,政府的多维度任务(如为辖区百姓提供基本的公共服务)受到严重的挤压,政府的许多活动以经济发展和筹集财政收入为主要目的。由此不难理解为什么财政的公共服务职能很难放到政府最优先的位置。由于下级政府需要承担上缴收入的刚性义务,加上经常出现“上级请客,下级买单”的情况,这意味着财政包干体制使得下级政府成为各种财政风险的承担者。

中央把行政事务以属地化的形式逐级发包给各个地区的行政首脑,但是这些行政首脑的任命权掌握在中央或直接的发包方手里。在实际运行过程中,一级地方政府的行政首脑的任命权通常掌握在直接的上级政府手里,这对应着“下管一级”的干部任命体制。每一个上级政府凭借其手中的人事任命权或举荐权都可以在其多个下属政府之间发动锦标赛竞争,以鼓励下属为上级所设定的目标而努力。这使得同一级别的各属地的主政官之间处于一种晋升竞争的关系。从乡镇这个当代最基层的政权组织到县、市、省,一直到中央,铺设了一个严格的金字塔式的晋升阶梯。一个基层官员从金字塔的底部出发,如果要一路晋升,就必须在每一级阶梯的激烈竞争中胜出,而任何一次失败和出局就意味着永远失去未来晋升的机会。这就是逐级淘汰的官场竞争规则。

经济学家倾向于把一个组织的治理结构看作是一系列治理工具内在互补和耦合形成的一个系统(Milgrom and Roberts,1990;Holmstrom and Milgrom,1994;Holmstrom,1998)。这个关于激励互补性的观点可以很好地帮助我们理解中国行政治理模式的系统特征。

如同我们以前所强调的,行政发包制本身就是各个维度间相互支持和相互强化的体系。首先,财政包干制是配合行政发包体制而设计的,而且两者在组织设计上存在明显的互补关系。[^4] 财政包干制是对行政发包制的一种支持性的制度安排,当行政发包中的分权程度越高的时候,财政包干制对下级政府的激励程度也就越高。这可以解释在改革开放之前每次行政权力下放运动都必然伴随着财权的下放和财政激励的增强,如1958年“大跃进”时期以及1970—1971年的放权;也可以解释改革之初的财政包干制的大规模推行与行政性分权也是同步进行的。1994年之后,中央和省内垂直化收权浪潮(即银行、国税、质检、国土管理等由过去的条块结合的部门逐渐变成中央直管或省内直管部门)以及中央与地方事权的调整正在冲击和改变着传统的行政发包体制,而这个过程与国家预算的一系列改革(如国库集中收付、收支两条线、预算外财政纳入预算内管理等等)几乎同步进行,这绝不是时间上的巧合,而可以视为是行政性收权与财政性集中管理之间互补性的变化。其次,属地原则与行政发包也是相互支持的。一方面,行政发包在历史上就是按照属地原则进行,另一方面,把人员尽量限制和控制在一个地域范围内,减少“流民”的数量,可以明确地区行政承包方的责任范围。中国行政治理自古以来所强调的属地管理原则其实就是为每个地区的总承包方和第一责任人划定一个明确的地理边界,以便真正贯彻“谁主管、谁负责”的基本原则。属地管理原则使得结果导向的考核和问责机制得以落实。

理解中国政府治理和国家治理能力强弱的关键在于,横向晋升竞争和纵向行政发包两者之间在本质上是互补关系。在多个承包人面对一个共同发包人(发包人可以决定承包人的未来地位和报酬)的情形下,横向晋升竞争通过奖惩规则和相对绩效评估为承包人提供了强大的争胜激励。而行政发包制赋予了承包人实际控制权和必要的行动空间(正式和非正式分权效应),包干式的财政和预算体制催生强大的财税激励,结果导向的考核和问责方式也让承包人为实现目标而“不择手段”:行政发包制的所有元素加在一起,相互作用,构成一个强大的激励系统,促使承包人必须更加努力地创造收入和做出绩效。高强度的横向竞争和深度的纵向发包相当于在承包人身上同时产生了强大的晋升激励、财税激励和问责压力,承包人还有实际控制权和自由裁量权提供的行动空间去最大限度地实现晋升考核的指标,这些因素相互促进和不断强化。晋升竞争和行政分包之间互补性的核心是实现目标的激励与实现目标所需的资源和空间的互补性。

地方官员晋升竞争的存在也使得中央实现逐级行政发包成为可能。如果没有中央和上级政府对下级政府官员的集中的人事任命权以及衍生的官场竞争,行政逐级发包会有可能演化为地方逐渐做大做实、最终与中央抗衡的局面。晋升竞争使得中央向下级政府放权而不担心失去控制。这是从防范最坏的可能性的角度理解官员晋升竞争的意义。从更积极的方面看,官场竞争促使地方官员为了获得提升而尽量投上级政府所好,减少地方官员享受的“租金”,迫使地方官员的行为最大限度地接近于中央政府所期望的目标。

在一个行政逐级发包的体制中,最核心是这些各个层级和各个地域的行政承包方和第一责任人。他们就相当于行政发包链条上的一个又一个“结点”。如果这些“结点”个个结实牢靠,运行正常,那么,整个国家就安然无恙。相反,如果许多“结点”失去了功能,那么,这个国家的行政治理就会立刻陷入混乱和瘫痪。如何让这些“结点”结实牢靠、运行正常呢?不同的层级的政府间以及政府的各个部门之间以合同方式确定目标“责任状”和“数目字管理”,就是90年代以来发展出来的治理手段,它们本质上是行政发包和官员晋升激励相结合的产物,内含于传统的行政体制,在新的历史条件下以一种较为极端的方式演化出来的。我们在接下来的第3节将详细解析。政府工作的责任制一般采取两种基本形式:分管制和包干制。分管制限于党政部门的主要领导,每个领导负责分管某一方面的工作,与分管制相配套运行的是领导和部门的包干制。比如在县市与乡镇的关系中,县市主要领导分别承包一些乡镇,督促执行和完成县市确定的一些中心任务;与此同时,县政府的部门也采取“局包乡镇”的方式,即由县市政府的职能部门在乡镇一级负责督促执行县市的政策指令。在镇村关系中,镇党委和政府的领导联合形成包村队伍,对全镇的行政村实行全面承包(马戎等,2000,第176页)。层层分管制与包干制的结合深刻反映了中国政府间体制内含的三个基本要素——行政发包、属地管理与晋升竞争——的高度融合,成为中国行政治理的一个极其显著的特点。

考虑到行政事务是层层发包,除了最基层的承包方之外,其他的中间承包方同时也是发包方和监督者,他们的激励与行为都有显著的放大效应,上面的一个“结点”坏了,下面可能要坏一批“结点”。层级越高,这种放大效应越明显和强烈。所以高层地方官员从来都是中国行政体制中的核心资源。如何对他们进行选拔、监督和激励,一直成为国家行政治理的核心任务。

官场竞争是中央或上级政府治理地方官员行为的最重要的工具之一。与逐级发包结构相对应的是一个逐级淘汰的官员晋升体制。当把横向晋升竞争嵌入到行政发包之中,发包方既要通过锦标赛竞争来激励下级承包方积极做事,出色完成发包任务,又要从多个承包方当中识别和选拔人才,使之成为上一级的发包方。这意味着委托人在地方官员的晋升竞争和流动中需要完成政治激励和政治选拔双重目标。政治选拔(political selection)近年来在政治经济学文献中成为一个热点议题(Besley,2005),而在中国的具体体制背景下官员流动的政治选拔功能最近才进入研究者的视野(Yao and Zhang,2015)。逐级淘汰的官员晋升体制的良好运行为行政发包的有效运转同时解决了两大难题:一是各级地方官员尤其是高层官员的选拔问题[^5] ;如果我们认为晋升与一个人的能力和绩效有相当的关系,那么,逐级淘汰的竞争可以把能力强和绩效好的官员选拔到最重要的岗位上;二是各级官员的激励问题,政治锦标赛要求每一级的官员为了保住官位甚至晋升,必须起码达到统治者设定的最基本的目标,如上缴税赋和维持治安,在大多数的情况下,地方官员还想做得比竞争者更好。在当代中国,我们看到各地为招商引资而展开激烈竞争,为经济增长而竞争,其背后一定有晋升激励的作用。

从行政逐级发包与官员逐级晋升的相互依存的关系中,我们也可以看到,中国行政体制的一个基本特征,那就是中央对高层官员激励的强烈依赖性。行政事务是层层转包,上级向下级发包,上级监督和控制下级;官员晋升也主要是由上级考核、任命或推荐下级。换句话说,上级官员是下级官员政治锦标赛的主持者和考官。如果高层官员放松了对下级的监督,或者在考核和任命下级官员时偏离能力和绩效标准,任人唯亲,营私舞弊,那么后果将非常严重。近年来媒体曝光了很多起官员的集体腐败的案件,如黑龙江的韩桂芝、田凤山,沈阳的慕绥新、马向东,安徽的王怀忠等等。这些腐败案都涉及跑官卖官,省级干部收受贿赂,为其下属谋官,其下属又向下一级官员收贿,如此构成了官场上一环扣一环的卖官链条。正常的干部考核程序和标准被完全废弃不用,关系和金钱变成了唯一标准,给当地经济发展和社会风气造成了极其恶劣的影响。所以如果上层领导腐败,将涉及大面积的腐败,当地民众也深受其害。在这个意义上说,跑官卖官比其他形式的官员腐败(如收受商人的贿赂)波及面更广,后果更严重,可以说是对政治锦标赛和行政逐级发包体制的最大威胁,因为它彻底瓦解了这个体制内在稳定的结构和机制。

总结中国传统行政体制的特征,我们可以看到,中国政府治理当中有两个基本倾向,一是行政发包下的地方分权化倾向,即事实上的行政控制权和自由裁量权向下层政府的集中和沉淀,这是和中国自古以来的集权体制一直相伴随、非常容易被忽略的特征。二是在行政治理手段的市场化倾向,即政府官员的激励方式采取了非常接近市场化的手段。和严格的雇佣制相对照,行政发包本身就是一种接近市场化的管理方式,除此之外,财政包干制、预算外资金的激励、与经济增长挂钩的官员晋升体制、政府层级间数字式的责任状管理,就非常像市场上的企业之间或企业内部所采取的方式,在西方文官制的政府治理中不容易看到。而且,在中国,政府层级越低,政府治理的分权化和市场化就越明显,比如到了县政府与乡镇领导之间,为了保证让乡镇领导完成县政府所确立的经济发展、计划生育和社会治安目标,乡镇领导被赋予了诸多的自由裁量权,其奖金数额和政治晋升与一些事前确立的量化指标(如完成的财政收入或招商引资的资金数额)直接挂钩,这和一个企业内部总经理与其下属的部门经理采用的激励方式没有什么本质的区别。事实上,乡镇领导通常就是乡镇农工商发展总公司的总经理,统领着乡镇下属的各类企业,为完成上级政府确定的利税和工业产值而努力工作。

行政发包制与政治锦标赛理论的有机结合实际上使得关于中国政治经济学两个重要但是一直相互独立的理论视角(中国特色的财政联邦主义和政治锦标赛)有机融合起来了。我们认为,行政发包制因为强调政府内部层级间的发包关系,财政制度安排只是其中的一个维度(当然是很重要的维度),因而比财政联邦主义内涵更丰富,分析更具延展性,也能够更加准确地揭示中国政府间关系和治理的特征。结合纵向行政发包和横向晋升竞争两个维度除了便于我们理解上面分析过的现象,还可能产生一系列有意思的拓展。

沿着横向竞争和纵向发包的互补性这个思路深入下去可以开拓一些新的研究课题。在改革开放时期,我国以经济增长为核心的官员政治锦标赛体制得益于计划经济时期中国M型经济结构的形成,使得地区间的经济绩效容易比较(周黎安,2007)。然而,从更长的历史角度看,1958年为了实施钢铁和粮食产量的“大跃进”,展开了政治锦标赛,“大跃进”的支持者和实践者受到大力表扬和高升,反对者和落后者受到严厉批评和惩罚(周飞舟,2009)。为了让政治锦标赛的激励效果更为明显,1958年同时进行了大规模的经济放权。由此看来,改革开放初期M-结构的形成也许与50年代“大跃进”时期毛泽东试图最大化政治锦标赛的激励效果有密切关系。在邓小平时代也是如此,先是简政放权和财政包干制的确立,然后是以经济增长为核心的地区经济和政治竞争,这也许不是历史的偶然。

横向竞争和纵向发包的互补性还表现在,如果横向竞争的晋升规则和秩序被人为破坏,如跑官卖官和裙带主义盛行,这将直接影响“纵向发包”的有效性,地方官员手中的自由裁量权就会演成为“合法伤害权”和贪腐的温床。带有零和性质的横向竞争也强化了属地发包的地域边界,各种地方保护主义盛行。周黎安、陶婧(2011)的研究表明,在控制其他自然因素的条件下,省交界地带的县区更容易陷入经济贫困,经济发展水平越接近的省交界地带越容易陷入经济贫困,这背后的制度性原因是省区官员竞争的合作空间狭窄,越是经济发展水平接近的省区越不敢合作,因为合作之后的相对收益越不确定。Eberhardt等(2014)发现,各省治理违规虚假医药广告的案例中来自外省企业的广告占了90%以上,也就是说,所谓的处罚虚假广告其实是变相地保护本地企业和官员的利益。

## 9.2 “集权—分权”悖论及其解释

从国际比较的角度看,中国一方面是最集权的国家,中央以下达文件和命令的方式几乎控制了大部分的决策权,从地方治安、税收、人事任命、教育支出到立法。最关键的是,根据宪法规定,中央政府具有管理全国行政、经济、社会等各个领域的决策权。从行政管理的权限看,一切权力来自中央,中央是剩余控制权的持有者。在《地方组织法》来看,地方政府的一切权力来自中央的授权,随时可以收回,一切都是行政授权,地方政府的决策也可以被中央政府否决,或者说所有行政决策的否决权在中央,因而不存在联邦制下的地方自治权。与此相联系,省级官员的任命权也在中央,人事权也是高度集中的。中国的集权不是体现在财权、人员和事权上,而是在人事权和行政控制权(相机剩余控制权)。[^6]

另一方面,中国可能又是最分权的国家。这里说的分权,是指行政性分权(administrative decentralization),即地方政府在执行其职能时实际拥有的决定资源配置或影响政策实施效果的能力。中国行政权力的高度分散可以从两个方面界定,一是事权高度分散在地方政府,除国防、外交和货币发行之外的几乎所有政府事务的执行权均在地方政府。二是因为中央政府监督和控制的困难,地方政府事实上享有大量的关于地方事务的自由裁量权。地方行政首脑有时被形象地比喻为“土皇帝”可以印证这一事实。

据楼继伟(2006)披露的数据,中国中央政府只有3万多人,加上执行机构大概是50万人,中央公务员的人数只占全部公务员的比例不足7%,而这一比率在美国是16%—17%,欧盟30%以上,日本25%,在印度为66%。正如我们在1.2节的图1.6所显示的那样,如果只是用政府机关人数作为计算口径,中央占全国政府机关人数的比例惊人地低,从1989年至2006年,最高值(1989年)只有1.68%,1998年国家机关改革之后还大幅度下降,跌至不足0.5%。中央财政支出占GDP的比率为21%,低于世界平均值25%,更低于发达国家60%,日本为35%。[^7] 从中央财政支出占全国财政支出的比例来看也是如此:中国在分税制改革之后,这一比例仍然不足30%,近年来更是低至15%。而欧盟的平均值在70%左右。即使与其他转型国家相比,中国的比例也是严重偏低的,这一比例在捷克为57%,匈牙利为56%,波兰为56.4%(OECD, 2002)。如果考虑到地方政府的预算外支出,那么中国中央和地方的财政支出之比还要更低。

中国悖论性的集权—分权组合不仅存在于中央和地方之间,也存在于地方各级政府之间,地方政府与职能部门之间,甚至职能部门领导与部门内部的科室之间,在不同层级间复制和再生。从中央到地方、职能部门的各级承包人连接成一个逐级发包和承包的关系结构图,其中我们看到了每个“承包人”的集权,各个“承包人”在其行政组织的边界内都是一个权力中心,也看到了各个“承包人”来自上级发包人的分权。[^8] 自上而下的各个层级和部门的“承包人专权”(即所谓的“一把手现象”)是“集权—分权”组合的核心现象,这里我们既看到无处不在的集权,又看到无处不在的分权,两者如此奇妙和紧密地交织在一起。[^9]

我们把中国政府间体现出来的高度集权与高度分权相统一的现象称为“集权—分权”悖论。据笔者所知,第一个明确提出这个悖论的是楼继伟(2006)。他虽然提出了悖论,但没有给出具体的解释。许成钢最近的一项研究指出了中国政治集权下经济分权的特征(Xu,2008),后来又提炼为“地区分权的威权体制”(regionally decentralizaed authoritarianism)(Xu,2011),事实上也涉及这个悖论的一些重要特征。本节的目的在于系统分析中国政府间关系的“集权—分权”悖论的性质、成因和影响,主要包括以下一系列重要和有趣的问题:为什么中国在政治体制上是一个高度集权的国家,而在具体的行政事务管理上又是一个高度分权的国家?上面引用的关于中国的数字背后对应着中国政府间关系的哪些具体和重要的特征?看似两个极端(中央的高度集权与地方的高度分权)如何整合在一起、成为一个内在一致的整体?这种特定模式背后的组织逻辑是什么?在目前的发展阶段,这种集权—分权组合与中国经济发展的特征和问题存在哪些关联?

国内学者关于中国政府间关系的研究文献很多,如谢庆奎等(1998)、林尚立(1998)、谢庆奎(2000)和朱光磊、张志红(2005)。从经济转型角度概括中国中央和地方关系的研究有“中国特色的财政联邦主义”(Qian and Weingast,1997)、“M型结构假说”(Qian and Xu,1993)。这些文献揭示了中国政府间关系的某些重要方面,比如强调事实上的行政分权方面、政府间“职责同构”现象,但这些研究没有考察地方分权与“职责同构”之间的内在联系,更没有涉及“集权—分权”悖论,即没有从看似对立的两端如何整合在一起这个角度给出分析。而本节的分析结果恰恰可以很好地解释中国M型结构、职责同构现象的历史形成和背后的组织逻辑。

我们关于“集权—分权”悖论的解释,主要基于我们上一节提出的分析框架,即中国行政体制的纵向发包与横向竞争的结合。属地化的逐级行政发包相当于把复杂和细致的行政管理事务从中央层层发包,按地域逐级分解给下级政府,由此可以大大减少中央政府的事务负担,使得中央政府可以集中于大政方针的制定和监督地方政府的实施。在层层转包的过程中,中间政府成为基层政府的监督者,对中央和上级政府负责;而中央只需要监督、控制和激励这些数目不多的中间政府的行为就可以了。由于中央政府是行政事务的总发包方,它可以控制谁做中间承包方,所以大政方针可以通过这些发包链条上的各级承包方而传递下去,对于下级政府的错误决策和不当行为也保有否决权和处罚权。与属地化行政发包相匹配的财政分成制则鼓励下级政府自筹财政经费,财政责任的下放也为中央免去了财政集中控制所需的庞大的组织设置和经费支出。所以,行政逐级发包和财政分成使得中央可以保持一个相对较小的政府人员和财政支出规模,同时握有最核心的决策权和监督权。这可以很好地解释中国一方面是一个集权国家,另一方面却一直保持非常低的中央行政人员和财政支出的比例。即便到了21世纪的今天,在面临日益复杂的现代化、市场化、国际化的背景下,中国拥有14亿之众的人口却只有大约3万左右的中央核心公务人员和大约15%的中央财政支出占比。在国际比较的背景下,这些数字看上去确实不可思议,然后它们却是中国在漫长的历史长河中一直保有的特征。这个核心特征的背后就是历史悠久的属地化行政逐级发包制。

所以,中国传统行政体制中集权的一面是体现在中央作为总发包方的权威上,这个权威的制度支撑就是对下级官员的任免权和对军队的绝对控制权,而分权的一面则主要体现在中间政府作为转包人的监督权和基层政府作为最终承包方的各项事权,还有在层层转包过程中由于中央监督的困难而逐渐下沉的自由裁量权。

另一个相关联的问题是,高度集权与高度分权看似两个极端的现象为什么能够整合在一起,成为一个内在一致的制度安排?如果地方政府拥有那么多的自由裁量权,“上有政策,下有对策”,那中央如何保证地方治理不会最终失去控制?进一步说,前面提到中央和地方之间存在一直被锁定的“双垄断”关系,地方政府也可能利用这种锁定关系胁迫中央。那么,中央和地方的集权—分权的制衡点在哪里?维持行政逐级发包正常运转的制度基础是什么?

高度集中的人事任命权是行政逐级发包的制度基础,也是整合高度集权与高度分权的一个关键。从秦汉一直到明清,中央政府对所有地方官员的晋升、调动和任命具有最终的控制权,所以所有的地方官员都是“朝廷命官”。更为关键的事实是,由于中央控制了省级及以下地方官员的任命,中央可以在同级官员之间发起锦标赛竞争。为了保住官位,在任官员也同时面临许多候补官员的潜在竞争。正由于中央或上级政府可以把它们认为不称职的官员撤职革办,地方官员就不得不竞相讨好朝廷,希望得到朝廷的肯定和赏识。总之,官场竞争成为中央约束官员自由裁量权、使之尽可能服务于中央目标的关键性手段。新中国建立之后,政治锦标赛的基本模式得以延续,并在新的条件下发挥更大的作用,比如把地方官员的晋升直接与中央政府所关心的政策目标挂钩,如经济增长、吸引外资、出口创汇、社会稳定等。

如果说,地方政府对其管辖地的公共服务具有相当的垄断性,即百姓不容易获得替代性的服务提供方(除了政府组织的移民以外,由于户籍制度的存在,公众在古代不容易跨地域迁移),这相当于增加了地方官员从中央政府可以获得准租金,那么,官员之间政治锦标赛的作用之一以官员之间的竞争替代了百姓流动(“用脚投票”)所引发的蒂伯特(Tiebout)竞争,使官员的政治命运必须依赖于上级政府,限制了地方官员享受的租金规模。前面提到,属地化的行政发包制便于界定地方官员行政责任,实施“谁主管,谁负责”的原则,这为地方官员的政治锦标赛的推行也奠定了坚实的制度基础,中央可以将一些重要的政策目标与官员晋升挂钩,通过官员之间的官场竞争实现这些政策目标。

中国目前面临的许多重大问题都与中国政府的“集权—分权”模式密切相关,如果我们不能理解该模式的背后的组织逻辑、历史演化及现实影响,就无法真正理解这些问题的性质和难点。比如最近人们讨论很多的财政体制改革和基层政府的财政压力,涉及的一个核心问题是政府间事权的划分,即中央和地方、省级政府与基层政府的职权划分。一些国际机构(如世界银行、IMF和OECD)关于当前中国财政体制问题的分析,几乎无一例外都会建议中国应该重新划分中央和地方政府的事权,各司其职,中央政府应该负责全国性的公共产品(如社会保障、环境保护),地方政府主要负责地方性公共产品。国内关于这方面的讨论也很多。虽然重新划分政府间的事权和财力分配是极其重要的,但我们的分析表明,这不是一个仅仅根据公共产品的受益范围进行相应划分的技术问题,它和中国长期以来的政府间关系有着深刻的联系,实际上是牵涉到整个行政体制改革的大问题。如果我们不理解造成当前中央和地方职责和事权划分格局背后的组织逻辑,就容易把问题简单化,只从财政维度看问题,给出的改革方案根本不具可行性。公共卫生体系的建立、医疗改革、政府监管等等问题也同样涉及中央和地方的职权分工,是行政发包制在不同领域所体现的政府间关系。

我们关于高度集权与高度分权相统一的分析我们更好地理解所谓的“国家能力”(state capacity)问题。关于中国“放权让利”改革是否严重削弱了中央对于地方政府的控制力乃至于失去了对经济的控制力,学术界一直是有争议的。王绍光、胡鞍钢(1993,1999)认为,自从中央实施“放权让利”的改革以来,国家的财政汲取能力一路下降,尤其是中央财政收入占全部财政收入的比例急剧下降,从80年代初的50%下降到分税制改革前的15%左右,这和发达国家的50%以上相比实在是一个异数。与此相适应的是,地方政府越来越变成一个独立的利益主体,地方财政支出的比重急剧扩张,预算外资金飞速膨胀,导致地方政府相对于中央政府和企业的地位迅速提高,使得中央政府缺乏必要的财力进行宏观调控。所以根据王绍光和胡鞍钢的观点,中国“放权让利”的改革导致了中国国家能力的下降,严重削弱了中央对地方政府和宏观经济的调控能力。王绍光、胡鞍钢把国家能力等同于中央政府相对于地方政府而言控制财税的能力。财政汲取能力毋庸置疑是国家能力的一个重要维度,18世纪以来西方国家的政权建设过程清楚地反映了这一点。可是,中国政府运行的逻辑从来就很独特,与西方国家差异很大。如果以中央控制的财税能力衡量国家能力,那么在中国漫长的历史长河中,包括从新中国成立之后到现在的大部分时期,中国的国家能力都是相对较低的,因为中央财政资源相对于地方财政资源的比例按国际标准一直属于偏低的一类。这个判断显然与学术界关于中国社会高度的政治动员能力的判断不相一致。

黄亚生(Huang, 1996)针对王绍光、胡鞍钢的观点提出了不同的看法。他认为,中央政府虽然下放了行政权和财权给地方政府,但是中央依靠其对地方官员的人事任命权来控制地方官员的投资行为,从而能够有效地对宏观经济进行调控。黄亚生注意到中央集中的人事权在国家能力中的中心地位。但是,我认为,中央政府对地方官员的控制不仅是根据地方官员的违规行为来决定其晋升,更重要的控制手段是在同级的地方官员之间引入晋升竞争,让地方官员为了晋升不得不尽可能满足中央提出的政策目标,只要这些政策目标能够进入地方官员的考核范围。地方官员的竞争使得中央处于相对有利的控制和谈判地位,中央通过控制人事任免权和发动官员之间的竞争来间接控制地方官员对于财政资源的支配和使用,所以简单以中央直接控制的财税多少来衡量国家能力显然是大大低估了中央政府的真正动员和控制全社会资源的能力。

从这个角度看,中国特殊的行政治理模式高度依赖于地方官员之间的晋升竞争机制,这是中央施加决定性影响的最重要的手段。如果绝大多数官员感到晋升机会渺茫,或者因为某种原因认为不晋升胜于晋升,比如对一些地方官员而言,做一个经济发达的乡镇的镇长胜于做县长或市长;或者官员晋升机制完全演变成了上下级官员之间“人脉关系”“跑官卖官”的游戏,那么,中国独特的集权—分权体制就失去了整合的制度基础,这时国家能力就真正成为问题了,而不论中央控制多少财政资源。

## 9.3 政府层级间的“责任状”和“数目字管理”

著名历史学家黄仁宇在研究明代的财政与税赋制度时发现,朝廷征税所依赖的一些基本数据,如田亩和人口的数字,在基层政府都是一笔糊涂账,或是随意估计,或是故意瞒报,因此感叹中国明清之后落后于西方乃是因为中国人不善于“数目字管理”。如果我们用同样的眼光来看当今中国地方政府的运行,一定会惊叹于当今政府管理对数目字的依赖和运用的程度。翻开任何一级政府的政府工作报告,我们都会发现一系列数字,用来概括当地过去一年完成的生产总值、财政收入、进出口总值、人均收入等等方面的增长情况,同时还会列举未来这些方面要实现的增长目标。这些数字既描绘了过去一年政府的绩效,又提出了未来的施政重点和目标。

在这里,数目字不只是用来描述政绩和目标的手段,它更是一种政府治理、问责和施政的工具。目前国内有很多文献详细描述了上级政府如何通过立“责任状”“军令状”的方式向下级政府下达指标,分解任务,实行目标责任制。其中最有影响的是荣敬本等(1998)提出的“政治承包制”和“压力型体制”。

根据荣敬本等(1998)的定义,所谓“压力型体制”,就是指一级政治组织(县乡)为了实现经济赶超,完成上级下达的各项指标而采取的数量化任务分解的管理方式和物质化的评价体系。政府层级间压力的传递具体体现在“责任状”上:上级把具体量化的指标和任务分解落实到每个下级部门或机构,责成后者在规定时间内完成,如果能够完成,甚至超额完成,则可以获得行政晋升和物质奖励;否则要承担行政责任和物质惩罚。在基层政府,比如县政府向乡镇政府一般下达招商引资、财政收入、计划生育等方面的量化指标。任务下达也同样发生在“条条”之间,各职能部门在完成县委下达的任务的同时,还必须完成自己上级主管部门下达的各项指标,比如年度内完成的罚款收费额度。[^10] 这些“责任状”所具列的承诺到了年终要进行评比和考核,在中期还有上级部门的检查和监督。

中国不同政府层级,问责和考核体系的指标化和数量化的程度也有所差异(赵树凯,2010)。省级政府对市级政府的考核以一般性的工作部署和检查为主,且围绕着经济社会发展指标的完成情况展开,但较少使用分数考核。但地级市政府对县级政府的考核,不仅有完整的数量化的指标体系,而且各项工作的业绩表现被折算成具体分数,在县(市)间进行排序计算,彻底贯彻了相对绩效评估的原则;县级政府的考核办法进一步细化,乡镇和县直各科局的工作绩效几乎都量化为分数,分数决定工作排序,评估所得分数的排序决定相关领导和人员的奖惩。到了乡镇一级,量化考核到了细密繁琐的地步,每一个部门、每一个工作人员、每一个村都被置于分数化考核的网络之中(赵树凯,2010,第148页)。

在政府间逐级实施“政治承包制”的过程中,有两个基本特征值得注意。

第一,虽然政府的许多职责是很难用量化指标进行刻画,但是,为了便于考核,上级机构尽一切可能把下属的工作任务数量化,把一些不易量化的指标也“强行”变成数字目标。比如民政局的职责包括救灾救济、优抚安置、社会事务、区划地名、农保、综合等方面,到了乡镇一级,民政工作责任目标书就由一系列需要完成的量化指标构成,包括匹配救灾款的数额、农村最低生活保障户数、退役军人安置率、储备粮、筹集的社会保障金、敬老院创收、筹集优抚保障、年内解决住房难的户数、村级集体公墓的火化率等等。[^11] 政府层级和部门之间的目标责任制还进一步延伸到政府部门内部工作人员的岗位责任制。“责任状”详细列举工作人员的各项职责,并对应一系列的评议标准,对于各种失职、违纪等消极行为的扣分标准详细加以说明。这种绩效考核的办法在实质上和政府层级间的目标责任制很类似,就是把政府人员的职责细化和量化,然后进行绩效考评。

第二,随着政府施政的目标不断分解到基层政府的过程中,有一个任务目标层层加码、逐级放大的过程。我们可以观察到的一个规律性的现象是,各乡镇和职能部门所订立的工作指标和增长率要普遍高于县级政府的目标值,而县级政府所订立的目标增长率又要高于所在的地区或主管市,地区和市的目标值又要高于省级政府的目标值。其实层层加码不一定是上级施加压力的结果,如第6.1节所分析的那样,它是多层级政治锦标赛的一个必然结果。省、市、县、乡各级政府的年度增长目标显然是各级地方政府自愿表达的愿望,没有中央强加的迹象。在政治承包制下任务分解和层层加码的现象恰恰验证和说明了多层级政治锦标赛的巨大作用。

在企业内部实行数目字目标管理方式完全可以理解,因为利润、成本、工资、销售额等等指标均是完全可以量化的,然而,在中国的行政体制下,对于多维度、不易测度的政府公共服务(诸如社会救济、环境保护、社会治安)也普遍采取“数目字管理”的方式,而且层层分解,逐级下达,这在国际范围内是不容易看到的行政管理实践。为什么我国当前的行政管理体制如此依赖“数目字管理”和“目标责任制”?

一种解释是,以“责任状”为基础的数目字管理是计划经济中计划指标管理的遗留物(如容敬本等,1998),因为在计划经济时代,计划指令代替市场调节,一切经济活动均在计划指令和指标控制下进行。我认为计划经济的影响可能存在,但并不完全如此。更根本的制度原因是中国独具特色的官僚管理体制,即多层级的政治锦标赛和属地化行政发包体制相互作用的结果。首先,中国不同层级政府之间的关系更多是行政发包关系。上级向下级授权,与此同时,也把行政事务发包给下级,当最高层的发包方关心经济增长和财政收入时,它自然会把这个目标分解和下达给下级“承包方”,然后一级一级地传递。其次,激励下属官员努力实现这些目标的最好方式是从中选拔那些最大限度实现或超额实现目标的人。激烈的竞争使得上级政府不得不依赖数字和指标的实现程度来选择优胜者,就像学术界的竞争使得大学主要依靠教师发表的论文数量和刊物的水平来判断,而较少直接考察科研的内在质量。

在改革开放之前,这种层层分解目标和任务的管理方式就已存在,而且不局限于经济领域。进入21世纪后,行政“责任状”和“数目字管理”作为一种治理方式又运用到国际国内社会普遍关注的节能减排问题。我们下面试图通过对这个具体案例的分析与解剖,进一步理解中国政府治理的内在逻辑与特征以及政治锦标赛模式和行政发包制在其中扮演的关键性角色。

由于对于国际社会的承诺,中国近些年来面临着非常严峻的治理环境污染的压力。“十一五”规划明确提出了节能减排的约束性指标,承诺在“十一五”期间,GDP能耗降低20%左右,主要污染物(二氧化硫和化学需氧量)的排放量削减10%。为此,中央采取了许多强有力的措施,包括增大环保的投入,出台一系列促进节能减排的价格、财税、金融等政策。其中最有力的措施就是加大对地方政府节能减排目标责任的考核力度。

中国的经济增长长期以来依赖重工业化,以粗放性增长为主,忽略了高污染和高耗能产业对生态环境的破坏性影响。虽然中央很早就注意到环境保护和可持续发展的重要性,但因为节能减排一直未能进入干部政绩考核体系,地方官员的认识不到位,责任不明确,政策措施缺乏力度,环境污染问题变得越来越严重。在很多地方官员看来,经济增长和招商引资是硬任务,而节能减排只是软指标。各地环保部门主要听命于地方党委和政府,如果后者主要关心经济总量的增长,环保部门就自然不会严格执法,担心成为当地招商引资和经济发展的障碍,环保标准就很难真正约束企业。作为监管者的政府激励不足是中国长期以来节能减排问题未能取得突破性进展的制度性原因。

在国际社会和国内可持续发展的双重压力下,中央把节能减排提到了重要议事日程。党的十七大报告明确提出,要落实节能减排的工作责任制。时任国务院总理温家宝要求把节能减排指标完成情况纳入各地经济社会发展综合评价体系,作为领导干部综合考核评价和企业负责人业绩考核的重要内容。

国务院对全国节能减排的总体目标在省市自治区之间进行了分解,提出了对省级政府和千家重点耗能企业每年节能减排的具体要求,并定期向社会公布各地目标实现的情况。在节能方面,国家发改委2007年11月出台了《单位GDP能耗考核实施方案》,制订了考核单位GDP能耗的量化指标,并规定了具体的考核程序和步骤。[^12] 对省级人民政府的节能评价考核,由国家发改委会同监察部、人事部、国资委、质检总局、能源办等部门组成评价考核小组,通过现场核查和重点抽查等方式形成综合评价考核报告,评价考核结果经国务院审定后,由国家发改委向社会公布。对千家企业的节能评价考核,按属地原则由省及节能主管部门负责组织实施,评价考核结果由发改委审核汇总后,向社会公告。

各省节能评价考核结果公布之后,地方官员和企业领导人就必须接受问责,节能完成情况成为干部政绩考核的一个重要指标,实行“一票否决”制。没有完成任务的省份和重点企业要做出说明,限期整改,领导干部在本年度不允许参加评先评优,也不能获得荣誉称号。该地区和该企业新建的高耗能项目,将一律停止核准和实行区域限批。对千家企业中的国有独资、国有控股企业的考核评价结果将成为各级国有资产监管机构考核企业领导人的重要依据,实行“一票否决”。而对于那些完成和超额完成考核指标的省级政府和企业,要进行表彰奖励。

在减排方面,国务院批转了《“十一五”主要污染物总量减排考核办法》以及《“十一五”主要污染物总量减排统计办法》和《“十一五”主要污染物总量减排监测办法》,这三个文件被称为“十一五”主要污染物减排考核工作的“三大体系”。类似于节能方面的激励措施,减排的考核结果纳入地方政府政绩考核的重要内容,实行一票否决制和责任追究制。除此之外,还给予一定的物质奖罚。考核通过的,优先加大对该地区污染治理和环保能力建设的支持力度;考核未能通过的,暂停该地区所有新增主要污染物排放建设项目的环评审批和项目核准,暂停安排中央环保专项资金。为了获得各省节能减排的准确情况,中央派出核查组到各地进行核查,国家统计局、环保总局也将对最后的相关数据进行核查。

中央给省市自治区下达的节能减排的约束性指标又层层分解到地市,直至县级政府、有关行业和重点企业。在这个背景下,地方各级党委和政府对此非常重视。省级政府纷纷与重点企业和市县签订了责任状,把节能减排的目标分解落实到责任单位和个人,采取严格的问责制。一些省份的领导甚至立下“军令状”,如果完不成节能减排的指标,就辞去领导职务。山东省省长姜大明的誓言最有震撼力:“什么叫约束性指标?约束性指标就是‘摘帽子’工程。山东省要完不成节能减排的目标,我姜大明辞去山东省省长职务。”甘肃省省长徐守盛也做出了类似的承诺。[^13] 据报道,江苏省的省委书记和省长各自承包了江苏境内一些主要河流的污染治理任务,上千家工厂关停。过去一直让人犯难的如何处理河流旁边的污染大户问题现在有破解的希望了。河北省规定,30个县和30个重点耗能企业三年之内必须完成节能减排的任务,如果不能完成,主要负责人就地免职。据国家环保总局污染控制司副司长赵华林透露[^14] ,过去地方政府等着中央拨款解决治污问题,盖楼堂馆所有钱,但要建污水处理厂没钱。在2007年推出“节能减排”问责制之后,形势发生了重要变化,包括县级的污水处理厂都建成了,凡是没有建成的,省领导是要离职的。2007年全国污水处理能力增加了900万吨,发展速度非常之快。造成局面改观的根本性原因是,现在考核省级政府的不再是国家环保局,而是国务院。

正如一位参加2008年两会的代表所指出的那样:“正是由于各级党委和政府在节能减排工作中真正发挥了主导作用,一些官员敢把自己头上的‘官帽子’挂在烟囱上,才实现了全国节能减排工作从2006年全面‘飘红’到2007年的‘双下降’的突破性进展。这让我们看到了一个负责任的政府和一批有作为的官员。”[^15] 在“责任状”和“官帽子”的压力之下,各地采取了各种措施压缩高耗能、高污染的项目。山东省作为中国的能耗和排污大省,2006年拒绝批准高能耗、高污染的项目30余个,责令87个新开工的项目永久停建,涉及资金200多亿元。广东省关闭了2600多家煤炭、化肥、冶炼、水泥、小火电机组等高耗能、高污染的小型企业,压缩冶金、建材、印染、造纸、火电等产能过剩、污染严重的产业,使高耗能工业占全省工业产值的比重降低到15.9%,低于全国平均水平。尤其值得一提的是,山西省的环保部门在省政府的支持下与金融、物价、电力、铁路等14个部门联合执法,2006年在山西全省对500多家企业因强行排污而采取了断贷、断电、断运、吊销营业执照等制裁措施。[^16] 也就是说,只要地方政府有意愿和决心去实现节能减排的约束性指标,他们一定有完成这些指标的足够的手段。这些证据再次说明,以前中国各个地区的环境污染和能源消耗问题迟迟得不到解决,甚至越演越烈,关键在于地方官员的激励没有真正调动起来。

在西方发达国家,治理环境污染的主要手段是依靠司法(如公益诉讼制度)和政府监管,结合市场的力量,比如向企业发放污染物排放量的配额许可,允许企业之间互相交易,这样既控制了总体的排污量,又保证了企业的效率。比如在美国,多数与环境保护有关的法律赋予了公民就违反环境法的行为提起诉讼并阻止该违法行为的权利。在1970—2003年间,有报道的与环境保护有关的公民诉讼就超过了1500起,迫使无数的行政机关和数以千计的污染企业不得不遵守法律,减少污染(古特曼,2008)。公民诉讼节省了大量的行政资源和纳税人的钱。中国则采取了独具特色的“行政激励”和“问责制”,核心环节是地方政府的负责人和企业负责人,通过层层施压,以“乌纱帽”做抵押,以此保证节能减排目标的实现。考虑到千家企业中不少是国有独资或国家控股,其企业领导人也拥有行政级别,在行政体制的晋升体系中流动,因而可以视为准官员,他们的行为具有行政官僚的一些特性。在关键时候,我们的体制仍然依赖传统的行政控制与调节,依靠政府手中所掌握的直接和间接的权力,对高能耗、高污染的企业和项目进行行政治理,而这些行政治理手段在中国当前的制度环境下又是相对最有效的。市场、司法和产权保护的力量尚未成为治理环境污染问题的主导力量。

2008年,食品价格上涨迅速,通货膨胀的威胁日益加重,引起社会的高度关注。温家宝总理在当年的政府工作报告中提出省长抓“米袋子”,市长抓“菜篮子”,事实上也是把问责制引入食品价格领域。这种做法在1996年治理通货膨胀时也曾采用过。这进一步说明,晋升激励是中国地方官员治理和政府治理的主线,一切重要事务,不管经济事务还是社会事务,到了非治理不可的地步,中央就会把它的治理状况纳入地方政府的绩效考核范围,与政治晋升挂钩,然后层层把任务分解、落实,以此寻求突破口和解决之道。

关于如何评价“责任状”和数目字管理的有效性,我们必须把这个问题放在政治锦标赛的视野里进行思考。什么事务适合通过晋升竞争去解决?什么事务不适合?作为短期的治理目标,这种方式也许可以立竿见影,但只是依赖行政晋升激励作为指挥棒,不能成为“灵丹妙药”,它会抑制其他制度的建设和运行,如产权保护和司法制度的完善,而且行政激励也会干扰市场的正常有序的运行。晋升激励的作用还取决于领导干部对于晋升的偏好强度、努力成本以及对于所考核对象的控制能力,如果某些干部不在乎行政晋升,甚至“跑官卖官”,锦标赛的激励作用就会大打折扣;或者地方官员不管如何努力,均难以完全制止某些不利事情的发生,那么以这些事情的发生作为“一票否决”来问责地方官员,有时可能会带来适得其反的结果。

## 9.4 中国经济增长的政治经济学

9.4.1 官员激励、政府治理与中国经济增长之谜

关于中国过去30多年高速经济增长,有两个基本问题是令人困惑的:第一个问题是,中国的政治体制尤其是行政体制仍然是高度集权的单一制,或者用本书的术语,是纵向发包和横向竞争的高度统一,这些中国行政体制的基本特征在改革前后大致是相同的,那为什么经济发展的成就会呈现如此巨大的差别?在改革之前,1953年至1978年国民收入增长速度平均增长6%,按照国际比较,这还是比较迅速的增长,但是就经济发展而言却是相对缓慢的,经济开放度低,企业技术落后,生产效率低下,基本消费品严重短缺,人民生活水平提高有限。而在改革之后30多年,中国经济实际GDP增长平均接近10%,企业的国际竞争力日益提高,6亿人口摆脱了贫困,人均生活水平大幅度提高。为什么这两个时期经济发展出现如此巨大的差别?如何从增长的政治经济学的角度加以解释?第二个相关联的问题是,西方产权和制度经济学理论,包括西方世界兴起的经验,一再强调产权和司法保护对于投资和交易契约的决定性意义,而中国一直以来,在产权保护和契约实施方面问题多多。更重要的是,地方政府对于企业和市场运行过程的干预程度一直很高,政府干预在很多方面替代了产权保护和契约实施。按照西方主流经济学理论,政府对市场的过度介入是不利于资源配置效率的,尤其不能由政府替代产权保护和契约实施。那么,为什么中国这些被认为破坏市场效率的“非标准实践”(nonstandard practices)可以支撑经济的高速增长和外资的大量涌入?

我们首先需要解释,在计划经济时期,中国传统的行政体制,如行政发包和晋升竞争机制,为什么不能发挥其独特的积极作用。如前所述,当新中国采取了中央集权的计划经济体制,推行重化工业化战略的时候,中国传统的行政体制被计划经济和工业化战略所改造,中央垂直部门出现了,传统上以“块块”为主的管理让位于“条块结合”的管理,而且中央集权的计划经济在很多时候对地方政府的自主权施加了诸多限制和制约,从而抑制了地方政府的行为空间。比如,在新中国成立初期,虽然行政和社会事务仍然大量发包给地方政府,但经济管理权限仍然集中在中央政府,如计划分配权、物质调配权、产品定价权和财政预算权,地方政府和企业基本没有多少自主权,几乎一切都必须听命于中央部委。地方政府和计划控制下的企业一样是属于中央计划的附属物。从1958年之后中国开始了经济体制改革的尝试,主要是向地方政府大量下放经济管理权限,这是新中国历史上第一次大规模的地方分权改革,可惜好景不长,匆忙的权力下放运动很快导致地方基建规模膨胀,物质供应短缺,通货膨胀和财政赤字。1959年中央开始收权和调整,又重新回到了中央集权的体制。在此之后还经历了几次“放权—收权”的循环,经济管理体制在中央集权与地方分权之间摇摆不定。显然,在中央垂直管理部门主导经济计划的体系里无法复制出地方分权和属地发包下经济发展的动力和活力。

最关键的原因在于,当时所倡导的地方分权的治国思路是在维护计划体制、禁止市场经济的大背景下提出和实施的。计划体制下的经济分权由于缺乏市场那样自动均衡的调节机制,实际上造成了地区分割、各自为政和宏观经济失衡,国民经济不得不经常陷入混乱和资源浪费。从地方政府来说,投资权、物质分配权的下放就如同得到“免费”的午餐,上工程和项目的利益(如利润、就业)由地方享用,如果出现资源浪费、经营亏损,最后由财政和银行买单。这种预算软约束的现象导致地方和企业的投资饥渴症,面对“负盈不负亏”的买卖,只要有投资机会,地方政府和企业就会毫不犹豫地投入使用(Kornai,1980)。而人为扭曲的价格体系(如加工产品价格高、基础产品价格低)制造了许多政策“租金”,鼓励各地纷纷投入加工行业,以获得差价和利润。生产资源产品的省区也不愿意把资源产品以计划调拨的形式运给外地,而想留下来自己加工生产,由此造成地区封锁和地方保护主义。地方政府和企业可以不管过度投资的财务后果和宏观经济影响,但对于中央政府来说,财政预算和信贷约束相对是硬的,因为乱发货币所引发的通货膨胀或变相的通货膨胀(物品短缺)的政治成本非常高昂,不可能长期持续,这使得中央的财政预算必须寻求平衡。当各地的投资如脱缰的野马失去控制的时候,中央不得不采取收权和紧缩的经济政策强行干预。所以地方分权可以调动地方政府的投资积极性,但与计划体制和宏观经济平衡不兼容,因而转化不成一种可持续的增长动力。

总之,在计划体制和重化工业战略的大背景下,地方官员的激励与国民经济有序发展之间无法找到一种激励兼容的机制,地方官员的作用要么在中央集权的体制下被束缚,无所作为,要么在地方分权的体制下被释放,但有如脱缰野马一般,最终让宏观经济失去控制,以大规模资源浪费和经济混乱收场。于是,中国经济就在“一放就乱、一收就死”的循环中艰难前行。

但是,我们同时必须看到,传统的属地化行政发包体制仍然对苏联集权模式产生了有力的抵制,迫使中国的计划体制进行一系列修正,最终呈现出迥异于苏联模式的一些重要特征。首先,中央计划与地方计划相结合,经济计划逐级分解,如同逐级发包一样。这与苏联较为纯粹的中央计划不同。经济计划的逐级分解的后果就是孕育了地区间物资调剂的灰色市场。这使得中国企业并没有完全生活在计划之中。另外,中国省区经济相对自给自足,各省建立了相对独立的工业体系。第二,60年代中期以后,中国地方政府所能控制的地方工业(包括社队企业)越来越重要,与苏联相比,中国中央计划的产品数量远远少于地方计划的产品数量,地方工业占全国工业产值的比例相对较高。第三,与中国大量分散的地方工业相一致,中小企业在中国国民经济当中扮演了极为重要角色,而苏联经济是以大型企业为主导,且以专业化分工协作的地区生产体系为基础。中国计划经济的这些特征为中国后来的改革开放提供了很多便利条件,比如向地方政府和企业“放权让利”的改革遇到中央计划部门的阻力会相对小一些;大量分散的地方工业有相当一部分早已在国家计划之外循环,依靠灰色市场运行,所以市场化改革对它们冲击很小,反而使其受益,中小企业更适应市场竞争的环境。而相对自给自足的省区经济使得中央能够实施渐进改革的战略(Qian and Xu,1993),在地方官员之间发动以经济绩效为基准的政治锦标赛,由此推动地区间激烈的经济竞争(周黎安,2004,2007)。

党的十一届三中全会以来的改革开放政策最大限度地激发和增强了中国传统行政体制中的积极因素,把地方政府从计划体制的束缚下解放出来,通过“官场+市场”模式,在相当程度上实现了官员竞争、市场竞争与地区增长之间的激励兼容,政治企业家精神和民间企业家精神的正向交互,各级地方政府成为中国改革开放和高速经济增长的重要推动者和发动机。

回顾中国改革开放的历程便不难发现,中国的政府治理是在从计划时期的集权体制全方位向传统行政体制回归,主要表现为以下三个方面的改革:第一,80年代初期开始的行政性分权把原来集中在中央一级的行政和经济管理权力大规模下放给省级政府,省级政府也依次向下级政府下放权力,这些重要的变化事实上使得政府间关系更接近于传统的行政发包体制,形成了地方高度分权的体制。第二,财政包干制秉承了传统上的财政分成体制,赋予地方政府更多的财权,使之拥有重要的剩余索取权,并更为自主地支配其财政支出,尤其是预算外资金给予了地方政府更多的财政自主权。第三,在政治锦标赛方面,考核地方官员的标准从过去的政治忠诚和政治素质转变为经济增长和提高人民收入水平,把官员自身的利益与其所在地区的经济增长的利益紧密相连,而人事控制权从以前的“下管两级”转变成“下管一级”则让省级政府可以在省区范围内逐级推行政治锦标赛,从而为区域经济发展和竞争奠定了一个激励兼容的制度基础。这些方面的系统改革不是向传统体制的简单回归,而是把传统体制内含的积极因素发挥到了极致,推陈出新,以“官场+市场”的方式为中国经济注入了新的活力和动力,为改革、开放和经济发展奠定了最重要的制度基础。

地方分权、财政分成制(包括80年代的财政包干制和1994年之后的分税制)、以经济绩效为基础的政治锦标赛究竟如何促进地区竞争,为中国的高速经济增长提供了坚实的制度基础,目前有很多文献从不同角度对此问题加以了解释。前面我们在不同场合提及其中一些文献的观点和贡献,如地方分权、“中国特色的财政联邦主义”、政治锦标赛、“官场+市场”模式的激励效果[^17] ,但迄今为止,“中国特色的财政联邦主义”和政治锦标赛这两支文献基本上是平行和不交叉的。然而,改革开放以来地方分权、财政分成和晋升竞争这三方面的改革不是孤立的改革,它们事实上相互支持、相互加强而构成一个内在一致的地方政府治理的新系统。从互补性和治理系统的角度出发,我们不仅能够把转型经济学文献这两条研究主线整合起来,更好地理解中国政府治理体制改革的内在逻辑,而且还能更深入地解释在这个治理系统之下地方官员激励的来源、性质及其影响。

首先,地方分权和财政分成是相伴随而来的,可以看作是剩余控制权与剩余索取权的统一。即便在改革开放之前的历次“放权”运动,计划管理权、物质分配权、投资管理权与财权(对剩余财政收入的索取权和对财政支出的支配权)从来都是一同下放给地方政府的。这背后的逻辑不难理解。在80年代和90年代中期以前,地方经济仍然以国有企业为主体,中央和地方分权的核心在于谁拥有对于所属国有企业的管理权限,这些权限包括计划管理权、物质分配权、投资管理权、产品定价权、招工和工资政策的决定权等等,涉及企业经营的每一个方面。在高度集权的计划体制下,企业的这些经营权限被分割在中央不同部委以及中央和地方政府之间。

就政府和企业的关系而言,从中央政府一直到乡镇政府,每一级政府都拥有自己所有的企业,连村委会都有自己的村办企业。任何公有企业最终都要隶属于某一级政府主管部门,但是政府作为所有者不一定拥有全部的经营管理权和收益权,处于不同行政隶属级别的国有企业在基建投资、物质分配、产品定价、工资和用人决定方面要受制于不同层级的政府部门的管理。这也许是中国特色的“所有权与经营权的分离”。80年代启动的行政性分权改革的一个最重要的方面就是把对于企业的经营管理权限逐步下放给企业所隶属的地方政府。但是,如果只是把企业经营管理权下放给地方政府,而不同时赋予地方政府作为所有者的收益权,那么这个改革将不会有什么实际效果。在80年代,国有企业的绝大多数利润需要上缴给所隶属的地方政府,然后地方政府将根据当时的财政体制决定是否全部上缴中央,还是自留一部分。1980年开始实施的财政包干改革就是解决地方政府的收益权问题。财政包干制相当于赋予地方政府对于企业创造的收益和利润的部分索取权,索取的部分取决于地方政府与上级政府财政分成的比例。在转型经济学的文献里,有学者把这种行政性分权改革称为重新界定产权的“产权改革”(Granick,1990;Walder,1992),即把企业产权,包括占有权、处置权和收益权,较为完整地给予了各级地方政府。同时赋予地方政府剩余控制权和剩余索取权显著地改变了地方政府对于所辖企业的激励和态度,因为此时两者的经济利益有了更紧密的联结。

当然,除了改善国有企业的经营绩效之外,地方分权和财政分成制还促使地方官员创造性地寻找新的经济增长点和新的财源。这一点在乡镇企业的异军突起上发挥了关键性作用。在改革早期,农村私人和联户企业受到当时国家意识形态和经济政策的歧视,然而,正是在乡镇和村政府的默许和支持下,这些企业被戴上了“红帽子”(被称为“集体企业”)而悄悄发展起来。我们在第8章详细描述了乡镇企业崛起背后乡镇干部所面临的强大激励。地方政府创造性地引进了土地有偿使用制度,通过出让土地和土地上的资产换得社会资本的投入,经营城市,大规模建设城市基础设施和道路交通设施,使得中国在短时间里出色地解决了道路交通和城市基础设施严重滞后的问题,这些创新背后也包含了地方分权和财政分成制对于地方政府的驱动。

其次,政治锦标赛与地方分权和财政分成也是相互支持和补充的。政治锦标赛必须与一些其他改革措施相配套才能发挥作用。我们前面曾提到,在一种严格的中央计划体制下不可能出现真正意义上围绕经济增长的晋升竞争。地方官员必须拥有一定的经济决策权力,能够支配一定的经济资源,即拥有较大的行动空间,才能真正对地方经济发展负有行政责任。此时,激励地方官员推动经济增长与发展才有意义。但另一方面,对于地方官员来说,保住行政职位是财政和行政激励发挥作用的前提。如果地方官员预期自己很快就要退休了,那么行政和财政分权的利益与个人的联系将减弱不少,影响后者的激励效果。在这个意义上,两者存在明显的互补关系。从地方官员来说,给定晋升和财政双重激励,他们最热衷于做既能带来当地经济增长,同时又能产生高的财税收入的事情。从中央政府来说,给定财政的显性激励和晋升的隐性激励,对于一个具体的地方官员则可以根据他(她)的个人特征(如年龄)决定这两种激励的组合。根据Gibbons和Murphy(1992)的理论,显性激励和隐性激励具有一定的替代性,比如对于年轻的代理人,其职业前景激励较强,那么只需给他(她)弱一些的显性激励(这样可以增加委托人的留成收入)就可以了,而对于年老的代理人,显性激励必须达到更大的强度。这意味着中央政府与省区领导人签订财政包干合同可能“因人而变”,相机决策。

政治锦标赛、地方分权和财政分成还有更深层的内在互补关系。从中央政府的角度看,地方分权和财政分成会面临两个基本的挑战,一是在一个高度集权的单一制国家里,地方分权和财政包干有可能强化地方的经济和政治实力,使之做大做实,对中央的统一权威构成挑战。如果中央慑于这种权力失控的危险,就可能会收紧权力,限制地方力量的发展。地方分权带来的第二个潜在的挑战是,当一个地区的政府政策对另外的地区产生跨地区的溢出效应时,溢出效应可能是正的(如加强教育投资),也可能是负的(如放松环境污染的监管),如果本地区的政府只关心本地区的利益而忽略其溢出效应,这时就会产生地方利益与国家利益的冲突。这种冲突如果非常严重,中央对地方政府的干预和监督就会增多,最终限制地方分权的程度。[^18] 中央主导的地方官员的政治锦标赛有助于应对地方分权和财政分成所带来的两个挑战。以集中的人事任命权为基础的政治锦标赛相当于维护和加强了中央的权威及影响力,让地方官员之间相互竞争,减少了地方官员所能享受的“租金”和谈判砝码,与此同时也迫使地方官员尽可能满足中央设定的政策目标(这些政策目标反映在设定的晋升标准上),缩小地方利益与全国利益的冲突空间。另外,官员之间跨区晋升和平级流动降低了地方官员对于辖区经济和人员的控制力,也就有效防止了地方官员在一个地方长期经营个人关系网络和利益同盟的可能性。正是政治锦标赛的这些便于中央控制地方的益处,中央政府才可以放心大胆地向地方分权让利。所以,集中的人事控制权和政治锦标赛的运用促进了中国地方分权和财政分成的深度和广度。根据Blanchard和Shleifer(2001)的观点,作为事实上的财政联邦制国家,中国和俄罗斯的一个重大区别在于,中国的财政联邦制是有政治上的集权作为保证,使得地方官员在推动当地经济发展的同时还必须服从中央政策的指挥棒,而俄罗斯的联邦制缺乏政治上的集权,经常面临加盟共和国的分裂倾向,导致了联邦制的不稳定性和离心倾向。

虽然两者是互补的关系,但是政治锦标赛下政府官员的晋升激励比财政和行政分权所带来的激励更为持久和基本。政府官员作为政治参与人,最关心的是政治晋升和仕途,而非地区的财政收入。只有从晋升激励出发,我们才可以很好地解释为什么从上世纪80年代以来财政体制和中央和地方的行政分权一直在变化之中,而地方官员推动区域经济增长的激励没有改变,因为政治锦标赛的基本模式一直没有改变。给定晋升主要取决于经济增长,财政体制由财政包干制变成对中央政府有利的分税制对地方官员来说并不是不能接受,而在财政包干期间中央一再改变某些省份的分成比例也不可能影响地方官员追求更高经济增长的动力。

中国的经济改革采取了“摸着石头过河”的“渐进主义”的策略,而这个改革策略的成功在很大程度上得益于地方政府积极的政策实验和创新,比如农村联产承包责任制的尝试和推广、经济特区的设立、土地有偿使用制度的创新、为私人企业提供政治庇护(戴红帽子)等等。对此,钱颖一、许成钢的解释是,地方分权和M型经济结构有助于地方进行局部政策实验,如果实验成功,经验就可以总结和提炼,然后向全国推广,这是中国改革成功的一个重要条件(Qian and Xu,1993)。Cai和Triesman(2006)指出,这种局部实验并不是行政分权和M型经济的特权,集权模式下也会存在局部政策实验的情况;最重要的是,局部实验的设计、部署和推广正是在一个中央集权的结构下才是可能的。这两种观点都有可取之处,但有一个关键性问题没有回答:如果不是来自中央的强制命令,地方自主推行政策试验的激励何在?如果政策创新需要大量投入,实验失败面临经济和政治风险,那为什么地方官员要冒险实验和创新?中国30多年改革历程说明,在“发展才是硬道理”的总体背景下,地方政府的政策创新和试验总是受到鼓励。如果成功,创新者会受到额外的重视和奖励,即使失败,当事人也不会被严厉惩罚。事实上,长期以来,地方政府一直在一些政策领域与中央政府博弈和周旋,如企业税收减免、土地批租、宏观调控、开发区建设等等方面,虽然中央三令五申,地方政府的“擦边球”和在“灰色地带”的博弈行为屡禁不止,对违规者的明确惩罚却非常少见,说明了中央政府对地方官员绩效观的隐性承诺。[^19] 只要能够提供一份好的经济发展的成绩单,一些政策违规行为也就不会受到严重的惩罚。正是这种奖惩的不对称性激励着地方官员尽力突破旧体制的束缚,寻找新的发展战略和思路。所以以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛和地方分权改革极大地鼓励地方政府的政策创新行为,虽然这也不可避免地催生了地方政府的违规行为。[^20]

综合上面的分析,我们可以看到,中国地方官员的治理的核心要素是地方分权、逐级发包、财政分成、晋升竞争四个方面。中国政府间关系没有严格采取韦伯意义上的官僚制,而是一种接近于市场关系的行政发包制。在逐级发包过程中已经给地方政府沉淀了相当的自由裁量权。而80年代开始的大规模地方分权进一步赋予了地方政府大量的自主权。行政性分权加上财政分成相当于赋予地方政府对于国有企业的实际产权,考虑到除了正式的预算内的分成之外还有预算外资金和非预算资金,后者属于地方的“小金库”,完全处于地方政府的控制之下,中央政府不参与分成,地方政府相当于拥有当地经济产出的高度的剩余索取权。而政治锦标赛更是把地方经济增长与官员个人的政治晋升直接挂钩。地方分权、财政分成和晋升竞争所推动的激烈的地区经济竞争又把地方官员置于政治企业家的境地,要从激烈的官场竞争中胜出必须勇于创新,出奇制胜,同时承担风险。而发展战略失策将导致资源浪费和错失机会,政府服务缺乏竞争力就意味着失去企业和投资,就意味着经济的失败和仕途的黯淡。所有这一切都是高度市场化的激励方式。中国行政治理把只有在市场和企业里才能看到的强度激励引入到政府内部,引入到多层级的政府间关系,这是我们理解中国地方官员激励与行为的真正的制度基础。在这个背景之下,我们就不难理解本节一开始就提出的问题:中国长期以来一方面缺乏正式有效的产权保护和契约实施制度,另一方面又看到地方政府对于地区经济的深度干预,按照西方的主流理论,这一定意味着政府对企业的搜刮、攫取和侵权行为,那为什么中国还能支持一个经济的高速发展和外资的大量涌入?事实上,中国行政治理中所蕴含的高度市场化的激励方式把地方官员的个人利益和企业的创立、发展紧密联结在一起。虽然没有强大有效的司法保护,但地方官员有足够的个人激励去吸引投资,保护企业利益,为企业提供良好的投资环境,包括硬件环境(如基础设施)和软件环境(如优惠税收、信贷担保政策),从而在根本上保护了企业的投资利益。简言之,地方官员在强大的激励下以行政保护替代司法保护,也许可以称之为“中国特色的产权保护”。正如我们前面所指出的那样,在大多数情况下,中国地方政府对企业利益的保护不是不足,而是过度,它可能是以牺牲当地民众和消费者的利益为代价实现的,如违规拆迁、纵容制假贩假行为、为重度污染企业开绿灯等等。

9.4.2 地方政府的政治预算周期

本小节试图探讨中国地方政府的政治预算周期现象,即地方政府的预算周期与官员任期之间的高度相关性。政治预算周期恰好揭示了中国政府体制下行政发包、财政分成与官员激励之间的深层互动关系。

在我国,党代会的召开是可以被预期到的重要政治事件。党代会召开的时间通常是官员集中换届的时间。在以经济增长为核心指标的官员考核体制下,我们有理由推测,地方官员有动机影响政府的预算支出,以便在集中换届的党代会召开前做出好的政绩,增加晋升的可能性。已有研究发现全国党代会与中国的经济波动、政府的“援助”程度等存在相关关系(李斌、王小龙,2006;Li,2011;梅冬洲等,2013)。还有学者发现省级党代会对制造业资源错配程度(周黎安等,2013)、矿难发生次数(Nie et al.,2013)等有显著影响。另外,官员的任期也是重要的因素。张军和高远(2007)、王贤彬和徐现祥(2008)都发现,省长、省委书记在任期内的经济增长轨迹呈现出先升后降的倒U型关系。钱先航(2012)发现,市委书记的任期与城商行贷款投放显著正相关。

我国政府预算编制和执行的程序表明,虽然地级市本级政府的预算支出从编制、审核到执行都有严格的程序,但是,地级市的行政长官尤其是市长具有一定的审批权限,有能力在职权范围内影响政府的预算支出。这样,地方官员便具有了在职权范围内影响财政支出的激励与能力,为我国地方政府政治预算周期的出现提供了可能。

有关中国政治预算周期的研究始于Guo(2009),作者使用1997—2002年中国县级政府官员的任期数据研究发现,县级政府支出的增长速度在县长和县委书记任职的第三到第四年达到最高峰,随后下降。然而,上述结果能否真正说明中国地方政府存在政治预算周期还有待商榷。首先,由于被解释变量为增长率,实际的样本区间仅有5年,并且刚好是中共十五大召开后的5年,样本区间极具特殊性。从作者的描述性统计中也可以发现,县级官员的任期和年份高度重合。例如,在1998年有78%的县长处在任期的第一年或第二年。这样即使在回归中加入了表示年份的虚拟变量,也仍然有共同的因素(common shocks)与县长的任期和预算支出同时相关,如国家和各省的五年规划等。其次,根据作者的估计结果,县长任期的拐点出现在任期的第3.6年,但是在1998—2002年间,平均每年有超过80%的县长处在任期的前三年,这意味着在绝大部分县长的任期内,政府支出的增长率持续上升,并没有出现先上升再下降的周期。

Tsai(2013)使用1980—2006年中国的省级数据,考察了党代会召开对全省财政支出的影响。研究发现,党代会召开两年前,地方政府更可能通过增加资本性支出从而使得总支出达到最高,党代会召开当年,总支出减少。考察官员任期后的结果显示,省委书记和省长的任期并没有对财政支出产生显著的影响。然而,王贤彬等(2013)在考察1994—2006年官员特征对政府财政支出偏向时将省委书记的任期作为控制变量,估计结果表明全省财政支出占GDP的比重、全省财政支出占财政收入的比重、全省预算内财政支出中基本建设支出占比均随着省委书记任期的增加而减少,但是官员任期对预算内科教文卫支出占比并没有显著影响。高楠、梁平汉(2014)使用1991—2011年的省级数据发现,在省委书记的任期内,财政支出先上升再下降,峰值出现在第2.9年。作者认为,在任职初期财政支出的增加源于晋升激励,而后期财政支出的下降可能是担心如果留任,本届的财政扩张将导致下一届较重的财政负担。Gong等(2013)在理论部分构建了一个生命周期模型,从官员的角度将政府支出分为冒险性支出和安全性支出,其中,冒险性支出是指能够带来经济增长,但也可能增加官员腐败的可能性从而影响到官员仕途的支出,如基础设施建设。安全性支出是指不会影响到官员仕途的支出,如行政管理支出。在实证部分,作者使用1999—2010年的数据,发现党代会召开前一年支出增长率显著增加,党代会召开当年,财政支出增长率显著减少,党代会召开后一年和后两年的估计系数并不显著。对于支出增长率的增加,Tsai(2013)和Gong 等(2013)给出的共同解释是政府增加资本性投入以获得看得见的政绩,增加官员被提拔的可能性。对于党代会当年总支出增长率的减少,Gong等(2013)认为,地方官员在党代会召开当年会采取“不求有功、但求无过”的策略,增加安全性支出,减少危险性支出。

我的一项合作研究对地方政府的预算周期进行了重新考察(吴敏、周黎安,2015)。与前述的文献相比,这个研究在分析的概念框架和实证方法上均有一些重要的不同。首先,前述文献主要以省政府为分析单位,聚焦于省及以下各级地方政府加总的财政支出。我们认为考察加总的财政支出的周期性波动存在严重的概念性问题。我国实行“一级政府一级预算”的预算体制,省本级政府一般只能安排省本级政府的财政支出,并没有权限干预下属各地级行政单位的财政支出。给定逐级发包的行政体制,各级地方政府具有相当自由裁量权控制本级的预算。因此,考察省委书记或省长任期的作用时,使用全省加总的财政支出是不恰当的,因为它混合了省、市、县多级官员不同行为主体的整体效应,难以真正识别出省级官员在其中发挥的独特作用。

其次,上述研究基于我国省级样本并且将党代会周期(党代会召开前一年、党代会召开当年、党代会召开后第一年等虚拟变量)作为解释变量存在一个很大的问题。第一,由于对于所有省,全国党代会召开的时间是一样的,因此加入党代会周期变量也就意味着无法再加入表示年份的虚拟变量,尽管有些作者在回归时加入了时间趋势项,但是由于无法完全控制年份的特征,即使观察到党代会对政府支出具有影响,这可能也并不是政治周期,而只是宏观经济周期在财政支出方面的一个反映而已。

我们的研究考察了省级党代会和官员任期对市本级政府财政支出的影响,与现有文献相比,我们的贡献体现在以下几个方面:第一,我们使用1994—2009地级市层面长达16年的数据,样本区间纵跨三届党代会,足够大的样本容量和足够长的时间跨度使得我们的估计结果更加准确。第二,我们在考察地级市是否存在政治预算周期时,并没有使用全市的财政数据,而是使用市本级政府的财政数据。这使得我们考察的是省级党代会和市级官员的直接效应,较少受到省级政府和官员行为的影响,也避免了县级政府和官员的干扰。第三,我们的研究可以将政治预算周期和宏观经济周期区别开来。由于全国各省级党代会召开的时间不一样,大约有一半左右的省党代会在9—12月份召开,另外一半省党代会在次年4—6月召开。这两组省份可以认为是随机分布在我国各经济区的(周黎安等,2013)。这样,我们便可以利用各省党代会召开的时间差,将党代会效应和时间效应区分开来。第四,我们还注意区分了政治预算周期和政治经济周期的不同。

我们使用的省级党代会召开时间数据为手工搜集整理,来自政府官方网站或省级统计年鉴。全国各省级党代会召开的时间大致可以分两批,一部分省的党代会在9—12月召开,另外一部分省的党代会在次年4—6月召开。[^21] 以2001、2002年的省级党代会为例,在2002年4—6月召开党代会的省有17个,在2001年9—12月召开党代会的省有14个。在2002年召开党代会的省和在2001年召开党代会的省平均分布在我国的东、中、西部。这两组省、市、自治区在地理位置和经济发展水平等方面并不存在系统的差异。纵观历次党代会,每个省在上半年还是下半年召开党代会的时间基本是稳定的,但是具体的月份因年份而异。例如,江西省2006年党代会在12月召开,2011年党代会在10月召开;天津市2002年党代会在4月召开,2007年党代会在5月召开等。

我们收集了1994年以来地级市市委书记和市长的任职时间、受教育程度、出生年月及其他个人特征。根据1994—2009年间发生市委书记和市长更换的数据,我们可以发现两个典型事实。第一,市长的更换频率系统性地高于市委书记。第二,从党代会召开前一年到党代会召开后三年,官员更换比例呈现出双峰特征,最高峰出现在党代会召开当年。在党代会召开当年,有29%的样本发生市委书记变更,有33%的样本发生市长变更。第二个高峰出现在党代会召开后两年,有25%的样本发生市委书记变更,有28%的样本发生市长变更。在其他年份,市委书记变更的比例大约在10%—20%之间,市长变更的比例在15%—25%。根据1994—2012年市委书记和市长任期的频率分布情况,可以看出,分别有21.39%、25.4%、16.58%的市委书记任期为两年、三年、四年。对于市长,任期为两年的比例最高,为27.33%,任期为三年的比例为26%。总的来看,90%以上的官员任期都没有超过6年,60%以上的市委书记和市长的任期集中在2—4年的区间,并且市长的任期少于市委书记。

我们的研究发现,地级市本级政府的一般预算支出增长率存在明显的新官上任效应:省级党代会召开后第一年和第二年,地级市本级政府一般预算支出的增长率显著高于省级党代会召开后的第三年。考虑官员任期后的结果表明,市长任期与市本级一般预算支出增长率间表现出显著的倒U型关系,最高点出现在市长上任大约2年时。市委书记的任期对一般预算支出增长率没有影响。细分支出类型后,我们发现,党代会召开当年,基本建设支出显著降低。此外,我们还发现地级市本级政府一般预算支出体现出的周期并不是由宏观经济周期和政治经济周期导致的,并且增加支出是地方政府的主动选择而不是为了给专项转移支付配套资金而被迫增加了支出。

图9.1展示了上述回归结果,纵轴代表地级市本级政府一般预算支出增长率,横轴代表时间(年),0代表党代会当年,-1代表党代会前一年,1、2、3分别代表党代会后第1、2、3年。如果不控制官员特征的变量,党代会召开后第一年和第二年,地级市本级政府一般预算支出的增长率显著地高于党代会召开后的第三年。并且第一年的增长率最高。具体来说,一般预算支出增长率在党代会召开后第一年比第三年高2.4%,第二年比第三年高2%。加入了市长任期及任期的平方项,回归结果显示,一般预算支出的增长率在党代会召开当年、后一年和后两年均高于第三年。党代会当年的估计系数为0.026,之后的第一年的估计系数最高,比当年的增长率高0.2个百分点,第三年高2.8个百分点。

上述估计结果表明,我国地级市本级政府的一般预算支出的确存在政治周期。在一届省级党代会召开前一年到党代会召开后第三年这五年间,市本级政府的一般预算支出增长率先上升再下降,峰值出现在党代会召开后的第一年。为什么党代会召开后的一到两年内,政府支出显著增加?我们认为,官员往往倾向于在上任初期使得当地在各方面展现出一些新气象,也就是民间所说的“新官上任三把火”,比如大力补贴公共交通系统、一次性解决企业拖欠农民工工资问题等。这些新增支出覆盖面通常较广,涉及教育、基础设施、行政管理等公共服务,官员以此打造自己的施政形象,显示其施政重点。

我们发现了地级市本级政府的一般预算支出具有明显的政治周期。我们在回归时加入了年份虚拟变量,并且利用各省召开党代会的时间差,排除了宏观经济周期对于上述政治周期效应的影响。但是,有人仍然可以提出质疑说,这里识别的政治周期效应也许不是关于预算支出的政治预算周期,而是关于GDP或财政收入的政治经济周期。考虑到工业增加值的增加与地方的GDP增长直接相关,我们把被解释变量换成增值税增长率。结果表明,党代会当年市本级政府增值税的增长率显著地低于党代会后第三年。这与西方国家关于在选举年份官员有降税倾向的结果一致。虽然对这背后机制的考察还有待深入,但是因为党代会当年增值税增长率表现出了降低而不是升高的特征,仍然足以说明在前文中我们发现的预算周期并不是由于政治经济周期导致的伴生现象。当考察官员任期的影响时,我们发现,市长任期和增值税收入增长率体现出U型的关系,在市长任期内增值税收入的增长率先减少后增加。市委书记的任期仍然没有影响。

我们还考察了预算支出的政治周期是否与预算外收入的周期有关。考虑到土地有偿使用收入是地方政府重要的预算外收入来源,我们把地级市本级政府土地有偿使用收入增长率作为被解释变量。估计结果表明,即使在10%的显著性水平下,表示党代会周期虚拟变量的估计系数也并不显著。这说明预算外收入也并不存在政治周期。综合这些分析,我们可以下结论说,数据分析所揭示的政治预算周期并不是政治经济周期的伴生现象。

由于我国的财政体制是分级管理,市级政府并不能直接影响县级政府的财政预算,因此我们推测省级党代会应该不会影响区县级政府的预算支出。回归分析的结果也表明,省级党代会并没有使市辖区县的预算支出表现出任何明显的周期性特征。

9.4.3 地方政府的预算软约束问题

前面我们已经指出,通过地方分权、官员竞争和财政分成所建构的高度市场化的激励方式是中国地方政府治理最突出的特征,这奠定了地方官员积极推动地方经济增长的制度基础。但是这种体制的成功之处也内在地带来了它的弊端和问题。比如在企业和居民的产权保护方面,中国目前是以地方官员为主导的行政保护替代司法保护,这难以避免政府侵权的现象发生,比如强行圈地和拆迁;在政府职能转变方面,地方政府一直在当地经济中处于强势干预地位,经常出现职能越位问题,如对市场监管不力,混淆运动员和裁判的身份。这里我们想重点讨论的是传统地方政府治理以下三大弊端,即地方政府的软预算约束问题、地方官员的公权私用和腐败问题以及司法地方保护主义问题。这些弊端都与我国当前地方官员激励与治理机制密切相关,反映出我国传统行政治理特有的弱点。

在政治锦标赛下,地方政府的预算软约束问题有可能会恶化,而企业的软预算约束问题则会以新的形式出现。首先,为了在经济竞争获得有利地位以增进政治晋升的机会,地方官员会动用一切政策手段(包括财政和金融工具)支持企业和其他商业扩张,这种只重数量而非质量的扩张很容易形成企业经营绩效低下和政府的财政赤字和负债。因为我们无法看到中央或上级政府让地方政府陷于财政破产的境地,这种预期又进一步助长地方政府粗放型的财政支出行为。目前基层政府面临的严重的政府债务问题在一定程度上就是这种预算软约束的反映。其次,在政治锦标赛下,不仅国有企业,甚至一些民营企业的预算约束有可能软化。一个企业,不管其所有制性质,一旦变成地方政府实现其经济赶超的工具,就不可能在硬预算约束的环境下经营。过去唯有国有企业存在预算软约束问题,现在民营企业也可能染上此病,原因就在于政治锦标赛改变了地方官员对民营企业的态度。

从行政发包来看,地方政府作为一级承包方对辖区的行政、经济和社会事务担负全部责任,而且履行这些职责所需的财政资源来自中央或上级政府拨付的部分从来都是有限的,很大部分还必须依赖于地方政府的自筹。与此同时,在以经济增长为基础的政治锦标赛下,地方官员又必须调动一切潜在可用资源,增加投资,支持企业,发展经济。地方政府作为一级承包方,其行政责任约束是硬的,如果没有完成上级交办的事务,或者在其职责范围内出现重大失职行为,或者在促进地方经济发展方面缺乏政绩,地方领导必须负主要责任,如接受行政处罚、失去提升机会甚至撤销职务。但是,地方政府作为一级承包方,在财政责任上所面临的约束是软的,如果出现财政赤字和债务,其个人不负责任[^22] ,通常也不会面临重大处罚,地方官员任期一到还可以走人,完全不负责任,中央或上级政府更不会允许出现重大财政赤字的地方政府破产。而如果地方政府的财政出现盈余,地方官员可以处置的资源随之同比例增多。地方官员的财政激励是“负盈不负亏”。

面临硬的行政责任和软的财政约束,地方官员的理性反应当然是动用一切财政或其他资源完成其行政职责,比如用银行贷款支持企业扩张,向社会集资摊派兴办公共工程项目等等。所以当我们看到许多地区在高速经济增长的光环背后是银行大量的呆坏账和政府的巨额债务,就不应该感到奇怪了。当然银行大量的不良贷款不能全部算到地方政府的头上,银行和企业也难辞其咎,但毫无争议的是,地方政府在银行不良贷款中直接或间接的“贡献”是巨大的。在1997年银行实现大区制之前,地方政府可以直接影响银行贷款,1997年之后银行系统从地方政府的控制中脱离出来,地方政府只能转向地方金融机构,如城市商业银行或农村合作基金会。地方政府对于国有银行仍然具有一定的影响力,它有自己的投融资平台和信贷担保公司,在协调银企关系方面发挥重要作用。这些影响融资的渠道成为地方政府实现其政治和经济目标的重要手段。关于中国基层政府的巨额债务的具体大小,我们没有确切的数字,不同人可能有不同的估计,而且还需要区分显性债务和隐性债务,但是没有人会否认这是一笔巨额的负担,最终还是需要由中央政府和上级政府埋单。截至2005年3月,财政部认定县乡政府直接显性债务是4000多亿元,而一些专家估计,中国县乡政府债务已突破1万亿元。[^23] 县乡政府巨额财政债务的形成原因非常复杂,但其中包含了地方政府举办“政绩工程”、扶持企业发展所引起的债务。大量在90年代中期形成的不良贷款往往是地方政府指定金融机构支持某些企业发展的结果。最后,债务链断裂,地方政府不得不向中央借入专项资金解决。国家审计署2013年12月30日公布了全国政府性债务的审计公报。截至2013年6月底,全国各级政府负有偿还责任的债务20.70万亿元人民币。如果包括政府或有债务,全国各级政府债务约30.28万亿元,其中地方政府债务余额17.9万亿元;一些省份的政府负债占本省GDP的比例较高,如贵州超过80%,重庆60%,云南、青海在50%左右。

在这种逐级发包的行政体制中,如何加强各级地方政府的财政责任和预算约束是中国未来行政治理面临的一个重要议题,否则,地方政府不顾自己行为可能带来的财政和金融后果,最后积累成庞大的债务问题,逼迫中央埋单,这个后果将不堪设想。

近年来各地房地产价格增长迅速,在这个过程中,地方政府是极为重要的推手。如前面第6章第5节所讨论的那样,对于大多数市县来说,土地财政成为政府财政的核心,与土地和房地产相关的财政收入是地方财政收入最重要的来源。土地财政运作的基本模式是,地方政府通过各种手段征用土地,形成土地储备,然后通过招、拍、挂出让。在这个过程中,地方政府成立各种政策性投资公司,以手中的土地为抵押向银行贷款,进行城市基础设施改造或旧城改造,改善城市的居住和投资环境。房地产价格越高,土地价值也就越高,政府从土地出让、建筑业和房地产业各个方面获得的财政收入自然越高,由此形成了以银行为中介的地方政府与房地产商荣辱与共的利益共生关系。在这个利益共生的格局中,地方政府、房地产商和购房者都需要从银行获得巨额信贷。如果房地产市场因为某种原因面临价格下跌、成交量下滑的情况,那么,银行将面临巨大的还贷风险,地方政府的财政收入也会下降,地方政府成立的各种投资公司也将背上沉重的银行债务。房地产价格的变动已不再是一个单纯的市场现象,而会直接引发地方公共财政的巨大变化。问题在于,地方政府作为房地产市场发展和城市经营的主要推手,无论在财政上和金融上所面临的约束都是软的,如果情况一切良好,大家皆大欢喜,如果情况糟糕,房地产商会面临企业倒闭、资产清偿的命运,而地方政府所积累的金融和财政债务最终靠未来的政府偿还,或是上级政府介入,但不管怎样,债务责任是很难落实到具体地方官员头上的。

随着市场化改革的深入,绝大多数企业日益变成独立自主、自负盈亏的市场主体,国有企业所面临的预算约束也在逐渐变硬。中国经济当中软预算约束问题的主体不仅仅是国有企业,更重要的还包括各级地方政府和准行政组织。[^24] 虽然中国的行政体制赋予了上级政府“责任下移、财力上移”的“特权”,“官大一级压死人”,但下级政府手中也有“弱者的武器”,那就是借债和透支,最后还不了,就让上级政府最终出面来埋单和收拾烂局,因为上级政府掌握的财力总是要多于下级政府,这种“倒逼”的威胁因而是可信的。分税制之后,中国政府间关系中饱受各界指责的问题就是“责任向下,财力向上”,导致大多数基层政府财政亏空严重,最后县乡政府债务积累到一个惊人的数字,所以更完整的表述应该是“责任向下,财力向上,最后是债务向上”。

## 9.5 国家治理能力的强与弱

国家能力或国家治理能力(state capacity)长期以来是社会科学界所关心的问题。一些政治学家和社会学家通过跨国比较研究发现除了一些经济变量(如投资率、储蓄率、技术进步)之外,国家的治理能力的差异是解释不同发展中国家经济绩效差异的关键性因素(Migdal,1988;Evans,1995;Kohli,2004;Fukuyama,2011,2014)。近年来经济学家也开始关注国家治理能力对经济发展的影响(Besley and Persson,2011)。这些研究文献均以国家整体作为研究对象,区分强国家(strong states)和弱国家(weak states)。我在一项研究中进一步区分同一国家治理能力的强项和弱项及其决定因素(周黎安,2014),不再简单地认为中国在治理能力上属于强国家或者弱国家,而是认为中国的国家能力强弱并存,治理能力之强弱取决于治理领域的性质,这有助于丰富和推进人们关于中国治理能力的理解。

关于中国国家治理的特征,一种比较流行的看法是,中国是“举国体制”,可以举一国之力,聚焦于某个重大目标,在国家层面自上而下大规模动员资源,即我们常说的“善于集中力量办大事”。在这方面比较成功的例子包括经济增长、航天技术、竞技体育、高铁、灾害救援和重建和流行疾病控制。Fukuyama(2011)认为中国突出的国家能力是中国区别于许多发展中国家(如印度、巴西、俄罗斯)的显著特征,也是中国过去30多年取得令人瞩目的经济高速增长的制度基础。

虽然我们在这些方面确实看到了举国体制的优势,但是在另外一些方面,比如食品安全、安全生产、扫黄和打击盗版、地方保护主义、环境治理,我们也同样看到自上到下的目标聚焦和资源动员,中央层面三令五申,也采取诸多措施,然而执行的结果差强人意,长期以来被社会各界所诟病。这说明并不是只要集中力量就能办成大事,举国体制也存在一系列瓶颈和“短板”。为什么中国可以解决“两弹一星”、神十上天问题,却对于食品安全、煤矿安全生产、环境治理等类似问题如此束手无策? 中国国家治理的强项与弱项究竟由什么因素决定?

纵向行政发包和横向晋升竞争可以成为两个基本的分析维度,帮助我们去解析政府各项公共事务的治理特征以及效果。如果我们将纵向行政发包的程度区分为高和低两种,同时又根据政府从事的公共事务对地方官员政治晋升概率的影响程度把横向晋升竞争的强度区分为高和低两种情形,这样我们就有了一个2×2的矩阵(见图9.2)。

图9.2左上方的方格对应着行政发包程度和横向竞争程度都比较高的情形,这包括经济发展(如招商引资、基础设施建设、经营城市)、竞技体育,还包括在绩效考核中具有“一票否决”性质的社会维稳和计划生育。[^25] 右下方的方格对应着行政发包程度和晋升竞争强度都比较低的情形,如国防、外交、国有商业银行、铁路、海关和航天工程,以及一些阶段性的国家项目如南水北调和西气东输等。这些政府事务中央主导的居多,地方政府更多是起辅助作用,自然也不直接进入地方官员的考核指标体系。右上方的方格对应的是行政发包程度高而横向晋升竞争程度低的政府事务,比如医疗、教育、环境保护、社会保障、食品安全、安全生产、区域合作等,这些方面都是属地责任,目前没有充分反映在官员绩效考核的核心指标上[^26] ,恰好也是当前老百姓抱怨最多、社会各界关注度最高的领域。左下方的方格为纵向行政发包程度低而晋升竞争程度高的事务,在中国当前常态化的政府事务中还难以找到满足这样性质的公共事务。

下面我想利用纵向发包和横向竞争这两个维度形成的分析框架重新考察三个被学者广泛关注的问题:第一,如何看待中国的国家治理能力和体制优势?第二,如何看待在监管领域中国独具特色的运动式治理和专项整治?第三,如何理解地区间政府作用的差异(即帮助之手与掠夺之手的差异)?

我们分析的线索从图9.2开始。非常有意思的观察是,我们所谓国家治理能力强的领域主要集中于图9.2的左上方和右下方的格子,即纵向发包和横向竞争两个维度属于“高—高”或“低—低”组合,而所谓治理能力弱的方面主要集中于右上方的格子,即纵向发包程度高和横向竞争程度低的组合。这种有序排列的背后蕴含了关于我国国家治理能力的哪些奥秘呢?

理解中国国家治理能力强弱的关键在于,横向晋升竞争和纵向行政发包两者之间在本质上是互补关系(周黎安,2008)。在多个承包方面对一个共同发包方(发包方可以决定承包方的未来地位和报酬)的情形下,横向晋升竞争通过奖惩规则和相对绩效评估为承包方提供了强大的争胜激励。[^27] 而行政发包制赋予了承包方实际控制权和必要的行动空间(正式和非正式分权效应),包干式的财政和预算体制催生强大的财税激励,结果导向的考核和问责方式也让承包方为实现目标而“不择手段”:行政发包制的所有元素加在一起,相互作用,构成一个强大的激励系统,促使承包方必须更加努力地创造收入和做出绩效。高强度的横向竞争和深度的纵向发包相当于在承包方身上赋予了强大的晋升激励、财税激励和问责压力,承包方还有实际控制权和自由裁量权提供的行动空间去最大限度地实现晋升考核的指标,这些因素相互促进和不断强化。晋升竞争和行政分包之间互补性的核心是实现目标的激励与实现目标所需的资源和空间的互补性。

横向竞争与纵向发包的互补性也意味着,当行政发包维持在低水平时,横向竞争也必须维持在低水平。在中国的体制背景下,这种情况对应着中央必须以垂直管理的方式介入,决策权和执行权主要集中在中央或中央直接控制的企业和机构,预算也是以中央资金为主,地方政府的作用维持在低水平,地方政府面临的结果考核压力也比较小,更多是配合性角色。但如果出现了横向竞争程度低而纵向发包程度高,或者反过来,就会导致制度“错配”和资源配置严重扭曲的情况。其实图9.2左下方方格空缺恰好说明了横向晋升竞争比较激烈的公共事务必须是地方政府承担足够责任且拥有足够资源和权力的事务,否则就是让承包方(地方官员)“带着镣铐跳舞”,这样的锦标赛竞争是没有意义的。

基于上面的分析,我们不难理解图9.2所呈现的关于我国国家治理能力强弱分布的奥秘:中国的举国体制发挥比较成功的领域[^28] 都属于横向竞争和行政发包两者以互补方式组合在一起的情形,而举国体制没有发挥出来、成效低的领域都属于两者出现了制度错配的情况。

举国体制相对成功的领域可以进一步分成两类,一类是横向竞争的锦标赛效应和行政发包的激励效应都较高、两者相互强化的领域,另一类是国家垂直管理效果较好的领域,实际上也就是将横向竞争和行政发包同时维持在低水平的情况。在第一类的情况下,上级的政策目标相对单一和明确,官员努力的结果容易衡量和考核(外资直接投资、GDP增长率、奥运金牌总数排名),责任清晰,落实到人,使得横向晋升竞争效果比较明显;与此同时行政发包程度高赋予了地方政府和官员必要的空间和机动性,便于层层动员和考核,激励地方官员参与竞争,进而强化晋升竞争的效果。这正对应着图9.2左上方的情形,招商引资、地区经济增长和竞技体育就属于这方面的例子。关于地方分权和政治锦标赛如何促进了地方官员招商引资和推动经济增长的激励已有很多的文献(周黎安,2008;Xu,2011),这里不再赘述,而是侧重分析一下我国竞技体育的飞速发展的制度基础。最近20多年来中国的竞技体育是以奥运战略为核心、国家层面的高投入和集训与地方体育和运动员个体的高度竞争相结合的体制。除了国家层面的高度动员和精心组织以外,地方体育局围绕奥运金牌的政治竞争也是一个极为重要的因素,因为它相当程度上决定了中国体育的资源投入、结构配置以及国家优秀运动员的选拔、培养和输送。按照这个逻辑思路,只要锦标赛效应打折扣的情形,该领域的绩效就会受到影响。中国不同项目奥运比赛的相对成绩的差异恰好说明了这一点。我国竞技体育最成功的方面体现在个人项目,而集体项目(如排球、足球、篮球)则长期表现不佳,一个重要原因是集体项目相比个人项目单个运动员的能力不容易衡量和体现,导致锦标赛效应弱化。社会维稳也是一个饱受争议的领域。一方面,对于地方官员来说,社会维稳属于“一票否决”的高压线,另一方面,群众上访和群体性事件成因复杂,在许多情况下非地方政府可以完全控制,但上级往往以结果进行考核(如包保责任制),使地方官员进退失据。

举国体制相对成功的第二类情形,如航天工程和高铁,满足几个基本特征:第一,项目是资源密集型,完成战略目标需要人力、物力和财力大规模集中和动员;第二,需要从上到下高度一致的协调、分配和整合(“全国一盘棋”),不适合地方分散努力,中央垂直管理则更好地实现资源的动员和配置;第三,地方政府提供辅助性支持,但通常不属于地方官员的常规事务,地方政府参与这些项目是锦上添花,做加法,没有利益受损者。这些领域的成功恰好是发挥了中央集权的优势,避免了横向竞争和纵向发包可能产生的错配效应。

我国的举国体制在一些重要领域遭遇严重瓶颈和短板,究其原因,还是行政发包制和政治锦标赛的积极作用同时遭到抑制造成的。首先,这些遭遇瓶颈和短板的政府服务,如质量监管、安全生产和污染治理,长期以来在地方官员的考核指标体系并不重要,经常属于被经济发展任务所牺牲的对象,成为GDP挂帅的政治锦标赛的受害者。其次,这些政府服务通常需要严格的规则、程序和精细化管理,长期、持续的监管以及廉洁尽职的行政人员:简单的资源动员和短期聚焦难有实质性和长期效果。而依靠规则程序、细节化管理和奉公执法则是行政发包制的软肋。行政发包制的“创收”模式(政府单位和个人的收入和福利取决于向监管对象的收费和索贿)和“内控”模式(只考核结果不关注过程控制和程序正义),非常容易导致监管者与被监管对象(企业或个人)之间的合谋和腐败,也会导致承包方对委托人的各种信息封锁和形式主义。腐败和形式主义是让各种政府监管失效的最大威胁。当晋升竞争激励失效之后,因行政发包而积淀在官员手里的自由裁量权演变成了“合法伤害权”,或者成为实现自身租金最大化的工具。[^29] 最后,这些活动通常需要跨地区合作,如环境治理、知识产权保护和维护全国统一市场,这也是行政发包制的常态治理所不擅长的,如前所述,地方分割和地方保护主义是行政发包制的常态现象。

行政发包制和政治锦标赛所面临的上述短板,在政府监管领域经历的属地管理—垂直管理—属地管理的体制循环中表现得最具戏剧性。在80—90年代假冒伪劣问题不断凸显的背景下,中央开始了政府质量监管的重大体制调整。2000年国家药品食品监管管理总局成立,药品食品质量监管由原来的属地管理一举变为省内垂直管理。与此同时,工商、质监等政府监管领域陆续进行了垂直管理的改革。然而,食品药品的质量事件2000年之后并没有得到有效治理,国家药品食品监督管理总局第一任局长郑筱萸把集中的药品审批权作为滥发新药、谋取钱财的利器,权力寻租和审批权腐败使得一批官员相继落马。最后,2008年中央决定放弃垂直管理,使之彻底回归原来的“属地发包管理”。属地发包管理强调地方政府在食品药品安全监管中负总责,即“谁主管,谁负责”。工商和质监遭遇了同样的命运。2011年国务院办公厅下发48号文,取消了工商、质监的省以下垂直管理。这些“体制回归”的现象说明,面对地方政府监管不力、地方保护主义的困扰,中央试图通过垂直化管理摆脱地方政府对政府监管职责的干扰,但垂直化管理本身并没有自动带来严格的规则、程序和细节化管理、长期持续的监管努力以及廉洁尽职的行政人员,相反,我们看到是权力集中之后更加集中的腐败、权力寻租和监管缺位。而在垂直化的监管部门内部是否沿袭局部行政发包的模式(比如罚没收入与部门预算和人员福利挂钩)也是一个疑问。另外,作为相当一部分监管资源(如信息、人员、执法)即使在垂直化改革之后仍然掌握在地方政府手里,监管责任上移给垂直部门之后地方政府不愿配合,听任和纵容违法企业的存在,也是导致最后监管失败的重要原因。

中国的现行体制容易集中力量办好一件大事,但难以同时办好众多性质不同的大事。最大的瓶颈不在于物质资源的约束,而在于层层发包体制下地方官员的有限注意力和激励机制设计的困难。一个地方政府同时面对多个部委、多个目标要求必然会有优先次序,必然会有权衡取舍,尤其在地方主要官员(掌握最终决定权和拍板权)最终的时间和注意力的约束。行政发包体制的核心就在于主要行政责任和权力赋予了一个人,即地方行政首长,所有上级的目标和发包任务都要进入他(她)的目标函数,经过他(她)的权衡和排序。在技术上又无法给这个承包方设计一个面对多目标都有同等强激励的评价和考核机制。所以在我国现有体制下,借用时下反腐常用的老虎与苍蝇的比喻,可说是“打老虎易,对付苍蝇难”。

在我国,面对举国体制造成的上述瓶颈和短板,一个补救的办法是从中央到地方的各种各样的专项治理行动,从扫黄打非、社会治安、环境污染到餐饮卫生,不一而足。这种在特定时间内特定部门自上而下就某一个特定领域或目标(如扫黄打非)进行的联合行动,可以看做是“运动式治理”的一种特定形式[^30] ,是很具中国特色的监管方式。为什么专项整治会成为中国监管体制的常态化操作?专项治理就是将多层级、多任务的日常治理模式转变成多层级、单任务的临时性治理,层层动员,单任务明确考核。它也是将日常多部门相隔而治(“九龙治水”)的治理进行临时整合和协调的治理。从我的角度看,就是借政治锦标赛之力(集中考核和竞争压力)在局部范围和时间内补行政发包制之不足,主要是部门间整合性差和多任务下的激励扭曲(一些非重点考核目标和任务被权衡和牺牲掉),迫使地方政府关注某些平时不关注、投入有限的方面。这解释了专项治理的几个特征。第一,专项治理主要集中在“软指标”(即上述举国体制的短板和瓶颈)而非“硬指标”(如招商引资)上,因为这种“软指标”通常是被“权衡”的对象,在发包制下管理效果差。第二,专项治理一般是间歇性的,且内容不断变换。这是相关中央部委或上级部门竞相“敲打”地方政府、使之投入资源注意相关方面的手段。第三,也是非常关键的一点,从委托人来说也存在一个常态绩效考核(多任务但突出硬指标)和临时性聚焦(单项考核)的权衡,因为承包方不可能把精力都放在运动治理的单项上,日常的常态考核才是关键。这导致了下级政府对于专项治理行动的应付策略、消极态度和形式主义。

关于地方政府在区域经济发展中的作用,经济学文献区分“帮助之手”和“掠夺之手”(Frye and Shleifer,1997;Zhang,2001;陈抗等,2002)。这里地方政府作为一个整体被区分为“帮助之手”或者“掠夺之手”。但是同样处于一个地方政府之内,地方主要领导和职能部门领导面对企业的态度很可能是不一样的。以经济发展为导向的政治锦标赛主要作用于地方主要领导(如市委书记和市长,副市长和副书记),而对于职能部门的领导(如环保局长和安监局长)和普通办事人员则难以用经济发展进行考核。[^31] 从这个意义上说,职能部门属于锦标赛激励效应最弱、行政发包赋予的自由裁量权最多的集合部。地方主要领导可以对企业投资的前期推动和审批发挥积极作用,但是未必能完全控制和监督每个职能部门事后的执法和监管行为,况且许多地方政府部门的“攫取行为”是以合法伤害的形式发生的。这说明一些地区的地方政府可能同时存在“帮助之手”和“掠夺之手”,不同领导对企业的支持力度大不一样,甚至相互矛盾,最终的效果取决于两者作用的净结果。媒体报道不断披露,一些地区在招商过程中存在“开门纳客,关门打狗”的现象。一个解释是这些地区的地方官员诱骗外地企业家到当地投资,然后利用企业投资形成之后无法轻易离开的事实进行敲竹杠和盘剥。我们结合政治锦标赛和行政发包制的互动提供了另外的一个解读。“开门纳客”其实反映了地方主要领导对招商的热情态度,因为他们非常关心招商引资带来的GDP和税收效应。“关门打狗”则是指具体职能部门在事前审核、尤其事后监管的过程不断刁难、勒索和盘剥。由这个讨论引发的一个重要的结论是,地方主要领导的领导力(leadership)是重要的,即地方领导对职能部门的横向整合、纵向制约和控制能力对一个地区的经济发展极为重要,关系到政府从掠夺之手到帮助之手的转换。[^32]

# 10 政府治理的改革

伴随着中国经济的市场化、全球化,中国政府的治理体制一直处于改革与演变之中。进入21世纪以来,社会聚焦的众多问题,如收入分配、社会保障、环境污染等问题,持续困扰着各级政府。一些群体性和突发性事件让地方政府穷于应付,进一步激发社会矛盾,严重侵蚀政府的公信力。中国政府一直在试图激活中华悠久治理传统的积极因素并取得了不凡的效果,然而,随着中国现代化进程不断深入,中国经济日益融入全球分工体系,传统政府治理的模式面临了前所未有的挑战。中国政府治理能否完成从传统向现代的系统转型呢?

## 10.1 问题与挑战

我们前面的分析表明,改革开放以来中国政府治理的最为突出的特征是属地化行政发包制和以经济增长绩效为基础的晋升竞争,即在一个高度集权化的政治体制中嵌入了高度的地方分权和地方官员的强激励方式。官员晋升与地区经济增长的相关绩效直接挂钩,多层级政府间流行的目标责任制和政治责任状,强激励的财政分成和预算外财政,结果导向的考核和问责等等,正是这些独具特色的政府治理体制,催生了地方官员在改革开放过程中勇于探索、敢于试验的热情和精神,为地方官员推动地区经济发展提供了强大动力。虽然中国经济改革之初面临诸多“先天不足”,如人均资源禀赋低、教育落后、农业、农村人口比重过大,计划经济时代还遗留了一个国企主导、高度集中的经济体制、畸形的经济结构以及不健全的司法体系,行政发包制和“官场+市场”模式为中国突破计划体制的束缚、实现高速经济增长奠定了关键性的制度基础。但是这种独具特色的政府治理体制同时带来了许多问题,有些问题在中国过去三十多年的高速增长过程中不断积累甚至日渐恶化。当前社会最为关注、反应也最为强烈的经济社会问题包括:收入分配不公与贫富悬殊,“三农”问题,环境污染,基础教育、医疗卫生、社会保障和基本住房的政府投入不足问题,官员腐败,粗放型增长模式和自主创新不足,地方保护主义,以及产品质量问题等等。从本书的角度看,这些问题在本质上均与政府的职能缺位有关,是属地化的行政发包制、政治锦标赛模式与市场化进程、人们日益增长的“公正公平”的诉求之间的内在冲突,因而可以理解为中国传统政府治理体制所面临的深层次问题。下面我们对它们的形成原因作一番系统的梳理。

根据我们前面的分析,属地化行政发包体制实际赋予了地方政府大量的事权和自由裁量权,改革以来的地方分权改革更是加强了地方手中的权力,这些积淀和下沉的权力使得地方政府有足够的空间保护地区的利益,“上有政策、下有对策”就是对属地利益的保护和伸张的一种表现形式,而下级政府与上级政府之间的讨价还价则是另一种表现形式。从机制设计的角度看,在一个高度集权的体制下给予地方政府保护自身利益的空间有助于保护地方政府的积极性,维持中央和地方之间的利益平衡。同时,这也带来了一定的权力制衡,使得中央出台重大政策必须考虑到地方政府的利益,中央和地方之间经常就一些重大改革进行协商和谈判,这可以看做是中国特色的权力制衡机制,即不是通过宪法的形式规定和设计的权力制衡,而是通过权力下放自然形成的制衡。但是地方分权也是有代价的,其中一个代价就是导致地区利益经常凌驾于全国性利益之上,有时使得中央政策在地方的执行过程中严重变形。“政令不出中南海”指的就是这种情况。而引入政治锦标赛相当于把地方官员的晋升利益和地区的经济发展更紧密地“捆绑”在一起,强化了属地的行政责任和利益边界,鼓励地方行政首脑整合属地内的一切权力和资源,促进地方利益的实现。各种形式的地方保护主义(如对地区市场的保护和司法地方保护)的一个根源就在于属地化管理原则和晋升竞争的结合。我们在第7章和第8章对此都有深入的分析。行政发包和属地化管理也在一定程度上弱化了中央对地区资源的再分配能力,造成属地之间因资源禀赋、优惠政策和经济发展的差异而呈现巨大的贫富悬殊和公共服务的不平等。当然,不同地区和收入群体之间的差异扩大在一定程度上反映了市场化过程中要素报酬(如教育回报)的差异化,有利于增进效率,但这些收入和福利的巨大差距同时也反映了地方政府再分配政策的缺失与中央转移支付存在的不足。

中国的财政制度长期以来主要关心财政预算主体的财政激励,并通过各种形式的包干制来强化财政激励,因而体现为一种“激励型”财政。新中国成立以来的政府间关系的调整基本上不涉及政府间事权的调整,永远都是围绕着财力的分配和创造而展开的。中国从财政包干制到分税制,本质上都是一种财政分成制,只是由过去的总的财政收入分成变成税种的分成,而且在省以下政府间财政关系仍然沿袭财政包干制。由于过于重视财政激励,而忽略了预算的公开性和问责性,忽略了预算的法律程序,同时较少涉及预算的公平性原则,即所有人在不同地区有享受均等化的基本公共服务的权利。预算外资金的大规模存在就是一个很好的例子。它作为激励型财政是一种很有效的制度安排,它完全由地方政府和行政事业单位自主支配,中央政府不参与分成,而且因为它不完全透明而免受上级政府的“征调”,所以,地方政府有充分的激励增加这部分资金。但是,谁也不会否认,预算外资金是中国地方政府和行政事业单位财政管理最混乱、最不规范的一部分,产生了很多问题。分税制改革也没有在根本上消除预算外财政,预算外资金(包括土地财政)占财政预算资金的比例仍然较高,而且不受预算监督的巨额预算外资金高度分散于各级政府、各个政府职能部门和事业单位。单位的“小金库”不公开、不透明,有可能演变成单位领导个人或少数人的“小金库”,滋生挪用、贪污、私分公款等各种腐败问题。由于中国政府间转移支付以专项资金为主,一般性转移支付不足,地区之间的财政能力差别非常之大,许多基层政府财政困难,政府负债情况非常严重。落后地区尤其依赖预算外资金来源,使得“乱收费、乱罚款、乱集资”问题丛生,长期以来企业、居民和农民不堪重负。

属地化的行政发包和晋升竞争进一步加剧了属地化倾向,直接导致了两个严重的后果:一是人为割断了属地之间的横向联系,阻碍了资源的横向流动和跨区域配置,全国性市场难以形成,我国目前的地方保护主义问题就是其中的一个集中表现。二是人为地把在技术上属于全国性的公共产品切割为地方化的公共产品,阻碍了全国性公共产品的提供。比如医疗和社会保障体系、企业和个人的征信体系、司法体系、环保标准及其实施都应该属于在全国范围内统一供给的公共产品,它们的供给是一个发达的市场经济不可或缺的“基础设施”,但目前大多是在属地范围内供给的,其水平和质量严重依赖于各地政府的财政能力和供给意愿,各地差距很大。严格的户籍制度进一步让绝大多数人束缚在一个属地之内,被动接受当地政府所能够而且愿意提供的公共服务。条块分割问题在一定程度上就是地方属地利益与全国性公共产品提供之间的冲突,如环境保护、统计、审计、质量监督、司法等存在的一系列问题。

以我国目前的医保制度为例,城乡居民的医保由城镇职工医保、城镇居民医保和新农合三项医保制度所覆盖,城乡居民总参保率维持在95%以上。但是这三项医保,尤其是居民医保和新农合基金的统筹层次主要集中在地市,有些省份甚至在区县一级。这不仅造成风险分担的效率偏低,地区间医疗缴费和报销标准差异大,还造成跨地区医药费报销受到很大限制。近年来人口流动规模不断扩大,异地医药费报销结算问题日益引起人们的广泛关注。2009年4月国务院发布的《中共中央国务院关于深化医药卫生体制改革的意见》就提出了“做好医疗保险关系转移接续和异地就医结算服务”的目标,但当时没有列出明确的时间表和实现路径。2013年8月国务院发布《促进信息消费扩大内需的若干意见》,提出“推进社会保障一卡通,建设医保费用中央和省级结算平台,推进医保费用跨省即时结算”。2016年大多数省份开始推行省内异地就医直接结算(即时报销),异地就医即时结算在一些省份试点,主要是省际之间“点对点”的合作,如湖北黄梅与江西九江、武汉与合肥、南昌与长沙之间。跨省就医及时结算尚需假以时日,而解决医疗的统筹层次偏低、地区差异大的问题则更是道路漫长。

我国的失业和养老保障制度也是执行属地管理的原则。失业保险制度起步于1986年,1999年《失业保险条例》颁布,标志着这项制度进入规范化发展阶段。根据人力资源与社会保障部发布的《中国社会保险发展年度报告 2014》,2014年参保人数约1.7亿,占城镇就业人数的43.3%,只比2009年的参保率提高了3个百分点,失业保障制度覆盖面亟待提高。失业保险金一般为最低工资的70%—80%,替代原工资的比例在很多地区不足30%。更重要的是,现行的失业保险采取的是政策省级统一、基金市场市级统筹,各地因为经济发展和资源禀赋的差异苦乐不均,一些发达地区基金大量结余,另一些地区则收不抵支,缺口较大。同样的情况存在于我国的养老保险制度。虽然在2013年中央就已经提出了实现基本养老制度全国统筹的改革目标,但各省养老保险基金仍然是“分灶吃饭”,缴费标准、养老待遇及基金结余情况差异极大。2015年广东结余超过6000亿元,北京结余2783亿元,浙江3009亿元,而黑龙江只结余88亿元,只够支付一个月的养老金。[^1] 经济发展水平、人口结构等因素使得各地养老基金收支差异大,由此给各地企业造成不同的缴费负担。目前各省职工基本养老保险个人缴费比例为8%,单位缴费比例各地有较大差异,比如广东和浙江是14%,上海21%,山东和福建18%,黑龙江为22%,大多数省份为20%。退休人员享受的养老金待遇也出现了地区性差异。衡量退休人员生活水平通行的指标是“养老金替代率(职工退休时的养老金水平与退休前工资水平之比)”。国际经验显示,当养老金替代率达到70%左右时,退休人员的生活水平与在职时大体相当,而低于50%时生活质量则明显下降。按照养老金与缴费工资基数的比值计算,2014年我国养老金替代率达到了67%,但各地居民社会养老保险基础养老金标准的差异很大。以2014年最新公布的数据看,上海市的标准是每人每月540元,吉林、河北、安徽等省份则还是维持在2009年的55元,两者相差接近10倍之多。而在同一省内,不同市县还有不少的差距。比如辽宁省基础养老金目前仅为每人每月70元,但大连市人社局已计划将基础养老金标准从每人每月150元提高至180元。湖南省基础养老金最低标准为每人每月60元,长沙市则为每人每月105元。[^2]

传统政府治理方式贯彻“谁主管、谁负责”的原则,把权力集中于行政责任人和承包方,如行政权、人事权、司法权等相关权力统统都“打包”给了第一行政责任人,这导致了党政不分,一元化领导盛行,权力过度集中于各级地方党委和党委书记,同时使得法院和检察院处于行政控制之下,严重受到行政权力的干预。司法地方保护主义问题非常严重,相应的官员腐败和司法腐败问题,尤其是“一把手”的腐败问题,都是在这个背景下产生的。行政发包体制与权力集中、一元化领导有着深刻的内在关系,这导致了官员腐败和寻租的问题。

我们讨论了政治锦标赛和“官场+市场”模式对于中国经济增长所带来的诸多影响。政治锦标赛是一把双刃剑,它的强激励本身也内生出一系列的副作用。首先是偏好替代问题,地方官员的经济增长偏好替代了辖区公众多样化的偏好结构。在经济发展和市场转型的早期,这种偏好替代有一定的合理性:当绝大多数人的温饱问题没有解决时,经济发展和收入提高是绝大多数人的最大需求。随着人们收入大幅增加、生活条件不断改善,人们的偏好和需求趋于多样化,此时GDP增长已不能准确代表辖区内居民高度多样化的偏好结构,这些多样化偏好最后如何传导为政府的公共服务内容就成为中国地方行政治理最大的挑战之一。更重要的问题是,直接承受地方政府治理后果的居民和企业无法直接影响地方官员的仕途,决定地方官员任免的是上级政府,所以目前的官员任命机制无法保证地方官员对居民和企业的多样化偏好做出充分和有效的反应。其次,在政府职能呈现多维度和多任务特征时,政治锦标赛促使地方官员只关心可测度的经济绩效(即所谓的“硬指标”),而对那些不在考核范围或者考核权重较低的指标(所谓的“软指标”)不予重视。根据多任务委托—代理理论,如果代理人的工作属于多任务性质,有些任务比较容易测度,而另一些任务不容易测度,给定委托人只对容易测度的任务绩效进行奖励,那么代理人就会把所有的努力转向受到奖励的任务,而忽略同样重要、但不容易测度的任务。这种多任务下的激励扭曲正是中国地方官员在“GDP挂帅”的考核机制下所发生的现象。GDP增长的竞争会导致一些地区的政府官员热衷于搞政绩工程,劳民伤财,这种情况在缺乏经济资源和发展机会的落后地区尤为明显。另一方面,高速经济增长同时带来了严重的环境污染和高昂的能源消耗问题,这也是政治锦标赛导致数量扩张冲动的后果之一。政治锦标赛使得政府官员只关心自己任期内辖区的短期经济增长,而忽略长期增长以及短期增长所带来的长期隐患,比如地方债的大规模积累。有些官员为了在晋升竞争中获胜甚至不惜数据造假,操纵统计数据,致使民间有“数字出官,官出数字”之说。当前社会反响强烈的“上学难、看病难、住房难”三大问题也和地方官员的激励扭曲有着直接的关系。地方官员把绝大部分由政府直接或间接控制的资金和资源投入到能够刺激GDP和财税增长的项目上,如基础设施的建设、开发区建设、城市改造和对企业的各项支持,而教育、医疗和廉租房方面的投资不足。这些投资只会影响辖区长期经济增长,对于官员有限任期内的经济绩效贡献不大,而且还占用了稀缺的投资资源,所以地方官员不愿意投入,致使“上学难、看病难、住房难”的问题长期得不到解决。早在1998年中央就提出财政体制需要从传统的“建设性”财政向“公共财政”转型,强调政府公共支出的重点由过去的经济建设支出(如基建投资)逐步过渡到以教育、医疗卫生与社会福利等公共产品的支出。然而,十几年过去了,这一转型仍然步履维艰。这一切的根源在于,当前地方官员面临的激励性质和结构与公共财政与政府职能转型之间存在基本的冲突。

再次,政治锦标赛进一步强化了地方官员与地方利益的联盟,使得中央的一些旨在改革政府职能、完善市场秩序的努力(如建立良好的市场秩序和全国共同市场)大打折扣。中国在90年代中期陆续改革了一些政府部门的管理模式,由“块管”变成“条管”,如工商、质量监督、税收、安全生产监督等,银行也实现跨越行政区的大区管理模式。这些改革本身就有限制和纠正地方政府干预市场的“越位”行为的考虑。但是,这些改革并没有从根本上改变地方政府对这些职能部门的影响力。原因在于,在政治锦标赛下,地方官员仍然需要这些部门对本地经济发展做贡献,一旦这些部门的做法(如严格质量监督与市场秩序管理)与本地的局部利益相冲突,地方官员仍然可以动用许多地方资源对这些“条管”部门施加有效的压力。近年来媒体广为曝光的煤矿安全生产问题,既有官商勾结、权钱交易的腐败问题,也有地方政府的政绩观在起作用(聂辉华,2013)。为了推动GDP和税收的增长,一些地方官员认为安全监管过于严格会干扰地方经济的发展,因而对安全监督工作直接进行干预,采取放松执法、消极对待违规生产的企业甚至偏袒保护这些企业的态度。在这样的环境下,安全生产监管的执行过程必然会偏离其真正的监管目标。

80年代以来中国的经济增长主要依赖资本投入和全要素生产率的提高。比如在1990—2000年,中国维持了大约10%的增长率,其中资本投入贡献了其中的50%,全要素生产率贡献了40%的份额,而劳动力的增长只占10%的份额(Liu,2014)。进入2000年以后,资本投入的作用进一步提高,而生产率的贡献则趋于下降。白重恩、张琼(2014)的研究发现,1979—2007年中国扣除要素投入增长之后的生产效率年平均改善速度约为3.78%,而2008—2013年间生产效率的年平均改善速度仅为1.40%。近年来生产率的下降直接导致了总体增长率的下滑,反映了中国经济增长的赶超效应(或称“后发优势”)趋于递减。劳动力从农业、农村向制造业和城市的大规模转移,对外贸易的高速增长,大规模引入西方发达技术,国企改制以及民营企业和外资企业相比国有企业的重要性加大,这些都是中国经济过去三十多年高速增长所享受的赶超效应和改革红利,也是全要素生产率增长的重要来源。随着时间的推移,这些赶超效应逐渐减少。改革红利空间仍然存在,但进一步打破国有垄断,提高国有企业效率阻力重重。与此相伴随的事实是,近年来中国日益依赖高投资率拉动增长,然而,投资收益率却在不断下降。这意味着按照传统的方式,“官场+市场”模式的潜力逐渐耗尽,官员依靠招商引资和政策补贴拉动区域经济增长的空间不断收窄。

过去十几年我国劳动力成本持续上升,使得中国的工资水平与一些东南亚国家相比已经居于高位。如果进一步考虑能源等相关成本,中国的制造业成本在国际范围内优势不再明显。根据波士顿咨询公司2014年的报告,如果美国的制造业成本指数为100,那么中国的指数是96,韩国102,日本111,墨西哥91,印尼83,印度87(Sirkin,2014)。近年来中国经济持续下行,出口困难,劳动力成本继续上升使得中国绝大部分企业遇到了前所未有的经营困难,尤其是出口企业,日子更为艰难。在珠三角和长三角已有不少企业纷纷关门、倒闭,有些企业已经开始向中国内地甚至越南、泰国搬迁。一些外资企业也在撤离中国,把工厂搬至东南亚的一些国家。曾经以成本优势确立世界工厂地位的中国制造面临前所未有的挑战。这说明,我们过去主要依赖成本优势和高投资率带动的增长已经难以为继,中国经济必须寻找新的增长模式,“官场+市场”的模式也面临转型。

上述所有这些问题归结起来,就是过去三十多年的改革开放过程塑造了地方政府在高速经济增长中的独特角色,它作为一个特殊的利益主体既是地区经济发展过程的重要推手,同时又是当前我国所面临的几乎所有经济社会问题的重要根源。

## 10.2 政府治理的转型

中国政府治理目前正在发生一系列深刻的变革,从行政发包制和政治锦标赛两个维度看,这些变革呈现了某种系统性特征,有可能改变原有官员激励和政府治理模式的相关要素和整体性结构。

我们先看行政发包制所面临的系统改革与演变。第一,中央和地方在行政权分配上的巨大变化。过去各级地方政府作为各级公共事务的承包方享有各种打包的治理权力,如“综合治理权”,尤其是在政策执行上的自由裁量权。这种局面正在发生重大的变化。自从上世纪90年代中后期以来,中央陆续推动“垂直化管理”浪潮,原来属于地方政府控制的许多权力陆续上收或局部上收,把传统的属地发包的管理模式过渡到属地发包与垂直化管理相结合。1998年人民银行撤销省级分行,设立9家大区制分行,此后,银监、证监、保监均参照实行垂直管理。地方分支机构的人、财、物均由中央负责,与地方政府脱钩。分税制改革之后,国税已经是省内垂直管理。工商、质检、药品食品监督、国土资源陆续变成省内垂直管理,与基层地方政府脱钩。2004年,国家统计局各直属调查队改制为派出机构,实行垂直管理。2013年党的十八届三中全会以来,垂直管理改革的力度进一步加强。法院、检察院正在由属地管理过渡到省以下垂直管理,以克服行政对司法的干扰和司法地方保护主义。纪检的垂直化管理已经启动,传统上我国的纪检体制实行双重领导,以同级地方党委为主,难以发挥监督同级党委的作用;现在的改革方向是地方各级纪委变成上级纪委的派出机构,各省市自治区、直辖市的纪委成为中央纪委的派出机构。长期以来,我国地方审计机关的主要负责人均由同级地方政府进行任免,审计的独立性难以保证。继纪检系统提出垂直化改革后,审计系统也开始了垂直改革,强化上级审计机关对下级审计机关的领导。比如在干部管理上,省级审计机关正职、副职领导干部任免须事先征得审计署党组同意或向其征求意见。各级地方政府统计数据造假的问题,一直以来被社会各界所诟病,这种局面未来也可能改变。各地的企业和单位直接把基础数据输入国家统计局统一的数据平台,为国家统计局直接计算全国及各地GDP奠定了技术条件。这意味着未来地方政府不再层层统计和上报GDP数据,而是静候国家统计局公布了。所有这些不断上收的监管和治理的权力以前都是中央政府发包给地方的,现在归并到条条部门,导致地方政府的自由裁量权大为减少,行动空间受到各种监管和约束,行政发包制越来越向着“行政化”的方向转变,发包因素不断减少。

第二,中央政府对于地方政府的考核,从原先的结果导向逐渐转向程序导向,结果导向与程序导向相结合;不仅看结果,还要要看地方出台和执行政策是否具有合法性及合规性。长期以来中央政府秉承“摸着石头过河”的渐进主义改革逻辑,鼓励地方政府不畏“禁区”,勇于探索,大胆创新。即使在改革过程中一些改革尝试有违当时的中央政策文件,甚至触犯法律法规,只要最终的结果被证明有利于改革开放和社会发展,就不会事后追究。我们前面提到的地方政府的许多重大改革,如安徽的家庭联产承包责任制农村改革,深圳的土地批租制度改革,都是典型的“先斩后奏”,或者说“先上船后买票”。随着“依法行政”“依法治国”理念的不断深入,程序合法性的重要性不断凸显。如果地方政府试验触犯了现有法律的话,即使是结果被证明是好的,也要追究当事人的责任,这是近年来日益明确的一个要求。最近中纪委、国务院督察组在巡视过程中除了聚焦于官员的作风腐败、财经纪律、经济问题之外,还转向了对于依法行政以及中央政策的执行力度的考核,并对此进行问责。如此强调程序控制和规范约束是一个近年来特别值得注意的变化。

第三,行政发包制中的经济激励部分,也在发生重要变化。1980—1993年的财政体制是包干制,分税制改革之后省以下还是实行财政包干制,省以下地方政府高度依赖于自筹资金去谋求发展,预算外财政在其中扮演了重要的角色。从1998年开始,中央正式提出从建设型财政向公共财政转移,财政由原来的经济建设的工具变成公共服务的手段,政府财政支出的重点将从经济建设向教育、医疗卫生、社会保障、社会治安和环境保护等民生方面转移。与此同时,国家预算和财政收支过程也要求服从公平公正和公开透明的原则,建立统一、完整的国家预算体系,地方政府的各种收入来源必须全部归到预算内,强调全口径预算,加强预算管理。如此一来,政府的各种收费都会被纳入到正式的国家预算体系,预算外财政纳入预算内财政的范围,实现收支两条线和国库集中收付,行政职责与经费来源进行分离,彻底克服国家财政部门化和分散化的弊端,加强人大、政协对政府预算的审查、监督和批准,实施预算公开。在最新一轮的财税体制改革当中,中央和地方的事权要进行重新调整,中央政府要加大支出责任,加大转移支付的力度。如此一来,地方财政的包干制色彩越来越少,事权与财力的匹配逐渐完善,向科层制的“全额预算”“足额财政”转移。以往各级地方政府高度依赖的土地财政、投融资平台也将受到很大的限制。即使未来地方政府被允许发债,也会受到一系列的限制,包括市县通过省一级去发债,规模也会受到限制。公务员的薪酬体系和激励制度也在发生变化。原先他们可以获得大量的灰色收入,以及各种地区性的津贴,现在这一块也开始慢慢地规范化了。公务员实施阳光工资,对收费立规立项,灰色收入减少。

政治锦标赛模式正在沿着几个重要方面进行改革,首先,试图完善地方官员晋升的考核指标体系,原先主要强调GDP的考核体系,现在已经在逐渐淡化,增加环境保护、民生等各项指标的考核(包括生态文明与民众满意度等)。强调根据不同地区、不同层级领导班子和领导干部的职责要求,设置各有侧重、各有特色的考核指标,追求经济发展的质量、效益和可持续性,同时与经济社会发展的多维目标(如生态文明、社会和谐)保持协调一致。

其次,把考核和决定干部晋升的委托人由原来单一的党委组织部门变成多重委托人,增加了人大、政协和普通民众。“自上而下的考核”开始与“自下而上的监督与制约”相结合。一些地区尝试在官员任命程序中引入差额选举。如深圳的市区,一些乡镇试点过镇长直选,改革单一的任命制。再次,公务员的职级与职务分开,晋升之路多元化,改变过去“千军万马过独木桥”的情况。公务员队伍有望区分出事务官和政务官。有些官员不需要晋升到一个更高的行政职务,但是可以升到更高的技术等级,匹配更高的工资收入。一些人专注于职业化和技术性的服务,做好了仍然有职级晋升的空间,而不一定要去追求更高的行政级别。

在官员政绩考核方面,从中央到地方一直在探索如何完善考核指标和考核方式。早在2006年,中共中央组织部下发了《体现科学发展观要求的地方党政领导班子综合考核评价试行办法》,强调改变单纯强调GDP增长的考核方式,从更加综合的角度对地方官员的政绩进行考核,考核的指标更强调一个地区的经济发展水平,比如包括人均GDP及其增长、人均财政收入及增长、城乡居民收入及增长等方面的统计数据和评价意见。《试行办法》还明确规定,在政绩考核过程中,应该根据民意调查的群众满意度,分析当地经济建设、政治建设、文化建设和党的建设等方面的状况与成效。民意调查还可以委托有关部门或社会中介组织入户调查、发放问卷、政府网站评议等方式在社会各个阶层的干部群众中进行幸福指数、满意指数、安全感指数的调查。民众满意度作为一个指标开始正式进入干部绩效考核,一些地方明确引入民意调查机制。2006年,山东省青岛市应用计算机辅助电话调查技术,由社情民意调查中心对所辖12个区市党委、政府履行职责的绩效情况进行民意调查,并将调查结果运用于目标绩效考核。每年山东的地市领导需要到济南参加“地市大考”。2008年5月德州和青岛两市的市长分别带领市直部门“一把手”到济南参加“地方大考”时,增加了采用电话随机访问的形式,调查当地常驻居民对该市党委、政府的评价。[^3] 河北省对有关社区市党政领导班子和主要领导实绩综合考核评价时也明确引入民意调查机制。2004年底,甘肃省政府委托兰州大学中国地方政府绩效评价中心,对政府绩效进行评价,而参与评价的是当地的民营企业。这项由第三方评价政府工作的活动被外界称为“兰州实验”或“甘肃模式”。第三方评估作为对政府工作的评价与监督目前成为一种流行方式。

从2008年7月起,中央组织部委托国家统计局每年在全国31个省区市以及中央和国家机关、中央企事业单位开展组织工作满意度民意调查。这标志着在官员考核和任免方面引入民众满意度的改革思路从局部地区的试验正式走向全国范围内的推广。民意调查的主要内容包括干部群众对组织工作、组织干部形象、干部选拔任用工作的满意度以及对组织工作的具体意见、建议。调查将采用抽样问卷调查的方式,在中央机关、省、市、县、乡、村各层次的干部和群众中抽取8万人开展调查,2008年7月组织实施了第一次问卷调查,至2011年连续四年实施了调查。中组部选择国家统计局作为第三方进行问卷调查是为了保证民意调查的客观性、中立性和代表性。

在如此大的范围内进行民众满意度的抽样调查在新中国的历史上还是第一次,它旨在改革过去单纯由组织部门进行干部评估和选拔任用的方式,增加干部任命过程的公众参与度。这标志了中国干部人事制度的重大变革,随着民众满意度在地方官员升迁过程中发挥的作用逐渐增大,地方官员将不仅仅要对上级政府负责,还必须同时对辖区内的民众负责,其施政理念和行为势必发生重大变化。民众满意度涉及政府服务的对象——民众对地方政府执政方方面面的主观感受和综合评价,只要满意度调查问卷设计合理,抽样原则符合中立性、客观性和代表性的原则,那么它所包含的信息就是丰富的、真实的和无偏差的。在这个意义上,它和其他可能反映地方官员政绩的指标(如绿色GDP或犯罪率)是不同的指标概念。当然,党委组织部门将如何把满意度调查的结果纳入官员绩效考核评估的过程,对于官员的任免到底将产生怎样的影响,还有待观察。

深圳市在政治体制改革方面的举措更加引人注目。深圳市在党政两方面实施市、区两级的差额选举制度,并允许参选人(包括自荐和党员联名推选人员)在一定范围内开展竞选活动。深圳市拟将首先在区政府换届中试行区长差额选举,扩大副区长选举的差额数量,候选人在一定范围内进行公开演讲、答辩,由同级人大差额选举出区长、副区长,为以后条件成熟时进行市长选举积累经验。[^4] 在实质意义上扩大党内民主、差额选举和候选人竞选无疑将成为中国未来干部人事制度改革的一个方向。如果说绿色GDP和引入民众满意度还是沿着如何寻找更为科学合理的绩效考核指标、完善政治锦标赛模式的基本思路,那么党内民主和差额选举将代表一种跳出传统政治锦标赛模式的新思路,让广大党员和群众逐渐成为政府代理人的最终委托人。

2013年12月9日中组部发布《关于改进地方党政领导和领导干部政绩考核工作的通知》,提出了几个方面的重要改革思路。首先,突出科学发展的理念,全面、综合考核政绩,明确强调不能仅仅把地区生产总值及增长率作为考核评价政绩的主要指标,不能搞地区生产总值及增长率排名。第二,对限制类地区,如农产品主产区、重点生态功能区以及生态脆弱的国家扶贫开发工作重点县,不再考核地区生产总值。第三,加强对政府债务状况的考核,把政府负债作为政绩考核的重要指标,注重考核发展思路和规划的连续性和可持续性。第四,实行责任追究,对在任期间违反科学发展、造成严重隐患和破坏的行为进行追责。

行政发包制和政治锦标赛所经历的重大转型直接源于传统政府治理模式所产生的各种弊端,比如垂直化收权运动是针对过去三十年地方分权产生的各种负面后果的一个纠偏性反应,政治锦标赛所导致的激励扭曲和偏好替代导致了淡化GDP的呼声和完善干部绩效考核的努力。进一步观察可以看出,上述政府治理所经历的转型和变化不是孤立和随机发生的,行政发包制内部诸维度的变化、行政发包制与政治锦标赛的转型相互支持和配合,在整体上呈现出一个协同性和系统性的演进方向和过程。而协同性和系统性变化正是我们前面反复强调的政府治理体系的核心特征。[^5] 总体上看,为了推动改革开放和经济发展,80年代和90年代国家治理是朝着赋予地方政府强激励的方向发展的:地方分权、结果导向的问责与考核、财政包干制以及以经济增长为基础的晋升竞争都有助于增强地方政府推动经济增长和提高财政收入的积极性。而当前正在进行的上述变革则是沿着弱化经济增长激励、增加上级政府的控制、强化公众监督和可问责性的方向进行的。传统的财政分成制强调下级地方政府和行政单位支出包干,自力更生,自谋财路,而忽略了预算过程的公平、公正和公开透明的问题。而以公共服务为宗旨的公共财政和国家预算体制的改革则强调预算的统一性、公平性和透明性,强调政府机关的行政责任与经费来源的严格分离,杜绝预算过程的腐败现象和政府对于公众的可能施加的“苛捐杂税”,增加对政府预算过程的监督和控制。垂直化收权也是强化中央政府和省级政府的控制、制约更基层地方政府的“属地化倾向”的举措,垂直化管理更强调跨地域的协同一致(如中央政令在各地域的贯彻执行)和对属地原则的驾驭和抑制(如人员、机构和预算独立于属地供给),传统的全能式“发包”的行政权力在相当程度上被“肢解”。而传统政治锦标赛朝着晋升标准和委托人双重多元化的方向变革也是要求地方官员关注更多的经济社会目标,包括一些不易测度和衡量的目标,使得激励结构更加平衡和分散,同时也使地方官员的经济增长的激励趋于弱化。[^6]

进一步的问题是,为什么中国的政府治理模式会发生这样一系列的系统性变化?有哪些结构性“参数”在推动政府治理的这些深刻变化?第2章我们提出了一个关于行政发包程度和范围如何决定的概念框架,强调有两大类因素在起作用。一类因素与公共服务的需求有关,涉及公众或公共服务对象对政府服务的质量要求以及这些质量要求对发包人形成的责任压力;我们尤其强调公共服务的政治属性,如公共服务的集体决策是否体现公平和公正的原则,公众有抱怨是否可以起诉和投诉,官员是否面临公众问责等等,都是与公共服务相伴随的质量特征。而公众的质量偏好和权利意识的强度,或者说公众对公共服务质量的敏感度与问责诉求、合法性预期及权利意识又密切相关。第二类因素与公共服务的供给有关,涉及公共服务提供所需付出的各类成本,如监督成本、财政约束等。公共事务的质量压力、统治风险与成本压力之间的权衡是决定行政事务是否发包以及发包范围的基本力量。

从上述理论出发,我们可以看到,属地发包体制运行所依赖的条件和环境在过去三十多年间发生了根本性的变化。经过近三十年改革开放的发展,以及经历全球经济和技术环境的巨大变化,中国经济一体化、市场化和全球化的趋势日益明显,互联网和信息技术的发展更是让全球各个角落都紧密连接在一起。这些变化带来了三个深刻的后果。首先,借助互联网和自媒体,现在任何一个角落发生的突发性事件可以一夜之间变成全国乃至全球关注和议论的焦点;一个地区的经济波动(如房价上涨、金融恐慌)会迅速波及别的地区,引发全国性甚至全球性反应。在传统经济体制下,区域冲突、局部危机难以演变成系统性和全国性动荡,属地发包使得矛盾就地解决,全国性危机也可以分散化处理,分而治之,遏制统治风险的蔓延和放大。经济的一体化、全球化和信息技术的发展使得一些局部的经济社会失序和冲突很容易被放大,对各级政府造成巨大压力,甚至演变成全局性和系统性的统治风险,这是属地化行政发包制难以应对的治理局面。其次,随着收入水平的提高和现代化不断推进,公民的参政意识、权利意识、问责意识都在不断增强,对政府提供公共服务的能力和质量提出了越来越高的要求。这些都导致中央必须强化对一些重大的、造成全局性影响的经济社会问题的控制力。银行的垂直化管理就是为了应对90年代初地方政府干预银行信贷导致的投资失控、通货膨胀和坏账积累。90年代食品、药品的安全问题频现促使中央下决心进行工商、质监和食品药品管理的垂直化改革。近年来公众对腐败、贫富差距问题、司法不公的问题的强烈不满都导致中央加强纪检垂直管理力度以及预算和工资制度的规范化和透明化改革,司法的垂直化改革也在进行之中。中央专项转移支付在地方政府预算支出的比重上升以及对医保、养老的投入增多也是力图克服长期以来不断拉大的地区间公共服务和收入分配的差距。最后,经济市场化和一体化也冲击着属地管理的体制,人口和货物的跨地域自由流动,让属地边界变得日益模糊。这可以解释为什么近年来国家试图打破医保和养老金的属地约束,使之跨地区可携带。这也可以解释为什么国家需要尽可能建立统一的司法秩序、审计标准和市场监管。近二十年不断推进的“垂直化管理”改革也是在这个背景下发生的。人员流动性加强和属地边界模糊也会促使中央和省政府承担更多对教育的投入比重,因为教育投资收益的跨地区溢出效应比以前更大了。当然,过去二十余年进行的垂直化管理是以中央政府和省政府的财政汲取能力提高为前提的,尤其是中央政府的财政汲取能力在分税制之后有一个明显的上升,为中央层面的一些重大工程和垂直化管理奠定了财政基础。

## 10.3 政府治理的现代化

中国具有世界上最悠久的国家官僚制度,文官治理的传统历经两千年王朝更替、国家兴衰而生生不息,一直延续至今。这种治理传统的韧性和活力清晰体现在新中国成立之初毛泽东对苏联模式的反思与改造,70年代初地方工业的兴起,到80年代地方分权与包干制的盛行。当我们处于政府治理从传统性向现代性转型的节点上,首先要回答的问题是:如何刻画中国政府治理的传统性特性?从本书的视角看,中国政府治理的传统性就是在中央集权之下的属地化行政发包制。具体说来,各级承包方拥有全面、系统的综合治理权,在上级统摄、监管之下,承包方仍然享有大量的自由裁量权和实际控制权。财政和预算以“包干”制为主,国家正式预算体系之内承包人的财力有限,自筹资金的压力大,预算外财政如影随形;“上级请客,下级买单”是常态,因而财政和预算的灵活性和非正式性是维系行政发包体制的基石。作为发包方的上级政府采用“谁主管、谁负责”的属地管理原则对承包人进行考核,这是自上而下、以结果为导向的考核和问责制,相比行政过程、程序和配备条件,上级考核更关注治理结果。

党的十八届三中全会提出了“国家治理体系和治理能力现代化”的总体改革目标。国家治理体系包括政府治理、市场治理和社会治理三个方面(俞可平,2014),本书更侧重政府治理的维度,与市场治理和社会治理也有着密切关联。如何定义政府治理的现代性?我认为,现代性至少应该包括三个标准。第一,依法治国,政府权力的运行必须合规合法,以体现公平正义的宪法和法律为准绳,实现制度化和规范化治理;第二,公民导向的问责,所有的公共决策和行为必须以服务公民为导向,体现公民意志;第三,治理的有效性,政府治理必须有效实现公共政策的目标,满足行政合理化和效率的要求。与现代性政府治理相适应的行政组织形式就是韦伯意义上的现代官僚制。中国传统的行政发包制虽然在外在形式和运行规则上有接近现代官僚制的特征,但是在运行机制和治理精神上与之形成显著和系统的区别。借用前面的比喻,行政发包制是在科层制的外壳之下植入了“发包制”的灵魂,“寓封建于郡县之中”。

以上述政府治理的现代性标准衡量当前我国政府治理体系的变革,确实可以发现许多积极的因素。当前政府治理所经历的变革的总体方向体现为从强激励走向弱激励,从经济建设型政府走向公共服务型政府,属地管理走向垂直管理与属地管理相结合,结果导向走向程序导向、规则约束和依法行政,这意味着中央对地方政府的控制力的加强,地方政府自由裁量权的减少,来自法律、制度和规范的约束不断增强。然而,一个重要的问题是,这种系统转型能否真正完成中国政府治理的现代性?或者说,在从传统性向现代性转变的过程中,有哪些可能的瓶颈和阻力?

在新中国的历史上,中央与地方的关系经常处于集权—分权的循环之中,有所谓“一放就乱,一收就死”的概括。2000年药品食品监督由属地管理改为垂直管理,2008年又回归于属地管理。当前的政府治理的改革是否会仍然变成历史上“收权—放权”的简单循环?

要回答这个问题,我们必须回到以前曾经讨论过的一个基本论点,那就是,在我国传统的行政体制下,中央政府在决定是否向地方政府放权时面临一个基本的权衡:一方面,向地方政府分权有利于调动地方政府积极性,发挥地方政府关于当地民众偏好的信息优势,让政府决策更好地反映当地的具体条件;但另一方面,向地方政府分权又会增加监督和控制的成本,地方政府可能会滥用中央政府的授权,甚至利用手中的权力与中央抗衡。[^7] 而造成行政分权两难困境的关键在于我国行政政府体制中信息获取与监督的性质,即中央政府主要依靠自上而下收集有关地方政府施政的信息,形成垂直监督和控制,而较少利用横向的或其他来源的信息(如民众的意见和评价)监督和约束地方政府的行为。

单一地依靠“自上而下”的信息收集和监督控制使得中国行政体制长期以来保持了高度集权的特征。比如在西方国家地方政府拥有自主决定税率、税种的征税权,而中国征税权一直属于中央政府的权力,地方政府无权决定税种和税率,长期以来不允许地方政府直接借债。中国的立法权也是高度集中于全国人民代表大会,地方人大的立法权相对有限。原因在于,中央政府担心这些权力下放之后会被地方政府滥用,最终生成各种各样的统治风险。另外,中央政府收集信息和监督地方政府的困难也可以很好地解释为什么我国政府间关系经常出现“放权—收权”循环。每当权力过于集中导致了下级政府无所作为的时候,中央政府就有放权打破僵局的意图。可是当权力下放之后,地方政府的行为难以受到监督和控制,酿成各种经济和社会问题,中央不得不上收权力,限制地方政府的行动空间,减少其违规行为。过去二十年不断推进的“垂直化”改革就是这种内在张力的后果。

在西方民主政体下,向基层地方政府分权有助于政治家利用信息优势,选民监督政治家。一方面,越是基层的地方政府越了解基层选民的偏好和当地经济发展条件,越有可能提供“因地制宜”的公共服务;另一方面,越是到了基层地方政府,政府与选民的距离越近,辖区内的选民越有能力监督地方政府的施政情况。[^8] 分权到基层政府同时解决了获取公众偏好的信息问题和公众监督问题。所以在西方民主政体下,分权的限度不再是监督和控制地方政府的成本,而是取决于公共产品的受益范围以及多层级政府从事某一项公共服务的比较优势。[^9] 民主政体消解前述的分权的两难困境的关键在于,监督和控制地方政府的功能不再唯一地由中央或上一级政府完成,而是借助了最有发言权的公众的评价和判断,通过选举投票来表达。当然,相对独立的司法对政府行为的监督和制约也不可或缺。如果地方政府在履行公共权力方面出现渎职或侵权行为(如土地拆迁、环境保护、食品安全),公民可以通过司法程序起诉地方政府。我们前面曾经提到,美国对于环境污染的治理更多是依靠司法诉讼对企业和地方政府的行为形成威胁和制约。

从上述讨论中我们可以清楚地看出,制约我国传统地方政府治理的最重要的问题是“自上而下”的监督和制约的困难,而单一纵向的信息收集加剧了这种困难。在这个意义上,中国传统地方政府的治理模式摸索出属地化行政发包和晋升竞争相结合的体制是在信息和监督的约束下的一个制度创新,即在高度中央集权下支持了地方政府的高度分权,又通过晋升竞争来制约地方政府手中的权力。过去改革三十多年的增长奇迹正是在这个政府治理框架下发生的。

为了不重蹈过去“放权—集权”循环的旧辙,我们必须打破过去单一的垂直监督的方式,引入更多的监督和制衡地方政府的力量,比如人大、政协、新闻媒体和普通民众的监督,尤其是司法体系对于地方政府的法治约束。引入多重的制衡和监督地方政府的方式之后,中央政府下放权力面临的信息和监督约束被大大放松,中央放权的两难困境在很大程度上可以避免,更多的权力可以下放给地方政府(如征税权和借债权),同时对于地方政府干预全国性公共产品的供给的行为加以制约和限制,中国传统的治理模式才有可能发生根本的改变。

让更多的利益相关方介入对于地方政府的监督、考核和任命也应该是干部人事制度的一个方向。如上所述,目前干部人事制度改革的一个重点是完善官员的绩效考核体系,比如除了经济发展指标以外,还在考虑提高环境质量、民众满意度等指标的权重,最近的绩效考核强调从短期和静态的考核逐渐向长期和动态的考核过渡。过去长期以来政绩评价侧重考察官员任期内的经济发展的表现,很少考察这些发展成绩背后所付出的显性和隐性成本以及长期隐患,比如政府负债、环境成本,更没有考察当下的增长对以后该地区可持续发展所造成的影响。如同考察一个公司的绩效(事实上地方政府具有准公司的性质),不仅要看它当前的营业额与利润率,更要看它的资产质量、负债率以及未来发展前景,有时后者更为重要。

在完善自上而下考核体系的同时,也应该重视自下而上、多元化考核体系的建立,而后者必须开辟来自民众的信息反馈渠道,结合民众或民众代表的评价意见决定官员晋升的命运。相比于自上而下,许多考核内容其实更适合采取“自下而上”的方式。比如公共服务的质量,行政效率和政府工作人员的表现,在自上而下的考核中可能就是一堆冷冰冰的数字,而老百姓有着切身的感受。为了让地方政府的行为更好地符合老百姓的利益,我们认为要进一步完善两个机制:第一个是建立来自政府服务受众的信息反馈机制,这些反馈信息可以传递给上级部门,也可以由一个公共平台曝光出来。这在当今移动互联和大数据时代是完全可能做到的,企业和个人如果遇到政府的不公正待遇,如骚扰、索贿、粗暴执法之类,可以录音视频记录下来作为投诉的证据,这是新技术带来一种新的监督和问责手段,给政府改革带来了新的思路和机会。地方官员工作出现问题,公众可以通过举报、投诉等行为进行信息反馈,而且不同的地方政府在横向之间也能形成对比。另一个就是监督问责机制。一旦通过信息反馈机制发现了政府在权力行使中的问题,就必须进行严厉的问责。

未来政府改革要加入新的改革因素——除了要在制度上引入并保证公众、媒体等社会力量对地方政府的监督,还要加强和完善体制内已经存在的监督和制约机制(如人大和政协)。关键是要让人大代表、政协委员更具有参政议政的独立性和建设性,最好引入一些职业化的人大代表,让他们有更多的时间去听取民意,更好地传达社会各方力量的声音。人大代表的职业化也可以更好地监督和问责政府官员。我们建议在组织部门的考核之外,加入人大、政协的考核意见,两者共同决定官员的任免。这种二元考核和评价体系在全世界范围内比较少见,将是未来可以探索的一个方向。[^10]

让辖区内的公众意愿能够影响官员的仕途,加之司法体系的制约和新闻媒体的监督作用。这样可以大幅度降低上级政府在考察官员所需的信息成本和设计晋升标准方面的困难,从而从根本上减少对传统政治锦标赛模式的依赖。减少对传统政治锦标赛的依赖又可以配合中央和地方权力的重新配置。传统的属地化行政发包的制度与政治锦标赛之间是高度互补、相互强化的制度安排。在传统的政治锦标赛的激励之下,地方政府以地方经济发展为第一要务,积极对外招商,调动地方一切资源(包括土地审批、工商、税务、银行、司法、公安、环保、安全生产)为企业提供实质性的支持,事实上这是一种以“块块”为单位横向整合许多属于条条管理的资源的方式。而一系列垂直化收权势必限制地方政府横向整合资源的能力,最终引致当传统政治锦标赛模式与垂直化收权之间的潜在冲突。但是随着政治锦标赛模式的改革——更多依靠差额选举和民众满意度去决定地方官员的晋升,传统上要求整合一切属地资源为经济增长服务的合理性和必要性大大降低,使得地方政府更加专注于如何提供当地民众满意的公共服务。

在推进政治民主化、法制化进程、加强行政权力的监督方面,我国政治体制改革已经取得显著的进展,改革力度不断加强。自从中国共产党在新的历史时期提出“依法治国”的执政理念以来,依法执政问题就提到了议事日程。《行政许可法》的公布标志着中国在依法行政的轨道上迈出了关键性的一步。行政行为必须要有法律依据,服从法律程序,受到法律的制约。与此同时,政府部门所面临的来自人大、政协和新闻媒体的权力制约和监督都在不断加强。人大、政协不仅在听取、审议政府工作报告和提交议案方面发挥越来越大的作用,而且将进一步在干部任免、财政预算审批、国家审计等方面获得更多实质性的监督权力。近年来国内的一些重大公共事件,如煤矿安全事故、产品质量问题、地方政府在土地拆迁方面的侵权行为等,都是由媒体首次曝光,然后引起社会各界关注,最后引起上级政府的介入调查和问责。行政问责、亲民与阳光政府成为政府改革的关键词。《政务信息公开条例》的颁布为敦促政府公开政府信息、保障公民的知情权和监督权奠定了法律基础。随着互联网在中国的普及和网民人数的大幅度增长,网络迅速成长为中国公共领域中监督政府施政和权力运用的一支重要力量。网民的舆论开始对政府的日常决策产生越来越重要的影响。所有这些变化都在不断加强对地方政府行政权力的民主监督、法律监督和新闻监督。

我们相信,随着这些监督方式的不断完善,中国地方政府治理可以逐渐向新的模式过渡。在新的模式中,地方政府仍然将拥有较大的自主权,但中央和地方政府现有的职责和权力分配将重新调整。由于地方政府的行为将受到一系列立法机构和相关机构的有效监督和制约,中央现在掌握的一些权力可以进一步下放给地方,如征税权、地方立法权、项目审批权和相关资源的分配权;另一方面,为了保证全国统一的市场和一些关系到全国范围的公共产品与服务的供应,限制地方政府“属地化倾向”的不利影响,目前地方政府控制的一些职能(如环境保护、审计、统计、司法)将逐步分离出来,或者交给一些相对独立的监管机构,或者交给中央政府的直属或派出机构提供,具体视情况而定。司法和检察系统从地方政府手中独立之后可以提供公民利用司法保护自身权利的机会,对于地方政府的渎职、侵权行为进行法律诉讼。政治锦标赛将由传统的以单一的经济增长和单一的委托人为基础的晋升竞争转变为多重晋升标准和多重委托人的晋升竞争,使差额选举甚至在一定范围内的竞选成为地方官员职务任免的一个重要方式,使得地方官员必须关注民生,提高公共服务水平,而非仅仅以推动经济增长为唯一目标。[^11] 再次,传统的激励型财政将向公共财政过渡,尤其是传统的形形色色的“预算包干制”将逐渐取消,财政预算将变成一个注重法治和程序、便于行政问责的过程,体现公平公正和公开透明的原则。

政府治理的改革是一个非常艰难的过程,必须依靠强大和持续的动力和压力才能推动。由于路径依赖和既得利益的抵制,政府治理体制的变化通常是缓慢的,惯性回归的情况也时有发生。一个有趣的例子是,各级政府的工作报告每年都要提出地区力图实现的一般物价水平的增长指标,在一些时期房价也被纳入地方官员的考核指标体系。但事实上无论地区的一般物价水平还是房价,在经济高度市场化和一体化的今天,都不是区域内地方政府所能自主决定的,要受到全国宏观经济形势以及邻近地区的物价和房价的影响。一般物价水平和房价控制责任的属地发包显然越来越不合时宜了,但它们仍然作为地方政府的施政目标,应该是传统属地发包治理的惯性因素在起作用。另一方面,时至今日我们仍然将房价和物价作为政府工作的重要目标,这也反映了行政发包制下“以结果论英雄”“只问结果,不问过程和程序”的考核问责方式。[^12]

另一个例子是绿色GDP概念的推行受阻。2004年3月由国家环保总局和国家统计局共同启动了“绿色GDP”项目,即绿色国民经济核算研究项目。绿色GDP核算试图从传统的GDP中扣除自然资源耗费成本和环境退化成本,以便更好地衡量地区经济发展的状况。该项目于2005年在全国十个省市开展了试点。2006年9月国家环保局和国家统计局联合发布了中国第一份《绿色GDP核算报告》。然而,这个项目经过三年的研究最后因为种种原因而被无限期推迟。环保部门和统计部门在发布的内容和方式上有重要的分歧,这是项目搁浅的一个重要原因。更重要的原因是,绿色GDP核算遇到了来自一些地方政府的阻力。因为一些地方官员担心如果扣除环境成本损失,这些地区的GDP增长会大打折扣。然而,当绿色GDP评价体系遇到重重阻力而搁浅之时,为了治理中国环境和能源问题,中央政府最终采取了对地方政府节能减排的问责制和责任状,这实际上是一种含有政治锦标赛因素的行政发包制的运用。我们最后还是依靠了政治锦标赛的传统手段来应对节能减排这样一个新问题。

中国政府仍然面临进一步简政放权的问题,减少政府对市场的干预,进一步降低经济运行对于政府的依赖,让市场在资源配置中发挥决定性作用,让政府行为受到法治的约束。事实上,我们强调官员激励与政府治理的重要性,一个极为重要的原因是迄今为止政府仍然处于经济社会的枢纽地位,经济与社会的发展仍然高度依赖于政府,政府官员的乱作为和不作为都将加害于经济与社会的有序发展。而解决政府治理难题的一个总体方向就是让政府“瘦身”,简政放权,依法治国,改变当前政府与经济和社会过度捆绑的局面,打造一个有限、有效的政府。在当今这样的一个席卷全球的、颠覆性的互联网时代当中,政府如何利用技术和思维创新推动自身的改革,重新定位,更好地服务于百姓和企业的需求,值得认真探索。

西方的官僚体制从80年代开始正在进行一场被称为“新公共管理运动”的深刻改革。新公共管理运动旨在“再造政府”,其核心的思路是摈弃过去奉为经典的韦伯式的官僚体制,如严格的职位分工、固定的薪金制、集中的财务预算等等,进而强调行政分权,在政府组织内外推行契约制,引入量化的绩效考核指标,启用物质奖励的方式鼓励目标的完成,采取竞争性的聘用制度,鼓励政府部门之间的竞争;对外把政府事务发包给市场中介或企业。一言以蔽之,“新公共管理运动”就是试图在政府部门引入市场化的激励机制,提高行政效率,改进政府服务的质量。从西方国家所进行的这些改革实践看,分权化、服务外包、市场化的激励方式和更彻底的绩效考核是当今西方国家公共管理体制的新特点。

中国传统的行政体制长期蕴涵着分权化和市场化激励的特征,在改革开放时期这两大特征更是表现突出。虽然中国行政体制与西方国家的新公共管理的分权化和市场化激励方式因制度背景不同而在内涵上不完全相同,但是就赋予基层行政组织更多的权力和更强的激励而言,两者确实有相似之处。

然而,更有意思的问题是,中国目前正在进行的行政体制改革却试图从一个分权化和市场化的政府治理模式过渡到接近韦伯式的官僚体制,比如近年来的中央垂直化运动、收支两条线改革、国库集中支付制度、政府采购制度的建立、公务员阳光工资制度都在深刻改变传统的属地化行政发包制。有学者提出,政府部门的收费和收税项目、标准、方式等,需经过人民选举出来的人大代表通过;政府各部门、经过授权的行政性事业单位不再具有收费和税收的立法权,其一切关于收费的条款的立法权应当上收人大;与此同时,大量行政管理服务部门被取消收费和罚款的权力之后应该全额由税收形成的经费供养起来。通过预算改革,以后政府部门的预算安排、编制设定、机构人员的控制权将由政府部门自身让渡给人民代表大会(周天勇等,2008)。这实际上就是要在根本上克服预算包干制和“国家财政部门化”的现象,让行政、执法与经费的获取相分离——这是韦伯式官僚制的一个基本特征,告别行政发包和财政包干制。

目前中国和西方国家都在试图纠正各自行政管理体制中的问题:中国行政体制为了激励政府官员推动经济增长而相对忽略了行政问责性、程序公平透明性和权力制约,在分权化和市场化激励方面走得太远;而西方公共管理体制因过于注重问责、透明和程序公平而牺牲了行政部门的激励和效率,在官僚化方面也走得太远。

中国传统的行政体制是一个“放手做事”的体制,强调放权松绑和给予地方官员强激励,地方官员做事不透明,缺乏规范和制约,滋生了很多问题,但充满积极性、灵活性和创新性。现在政府治理逐渐向“束手做事”的体制过渡,即向“公平、透明、问责”的行政原则过渡,强调公民的权利保护,强调监督和制约,但官员的激励可能不足。如何在官员的激励与约束之间实现平衡,保持责任、权力和物质报酬的合理统一,如何在政府治理转型中保留根植于中国传统体制的积极因素,是当今政府治理改革的一大难题,也是未来亟待研究的一个重要课题。

[[6]](#part15.html_filepos1310133) 在政治锦标赛的晋升标准中引入新指标的收益是让地方官员不再完全集中于实现过去传统的指标,必须转移一部分注意力关注新指标方面的绩效,使地方官员的激励结构更加平衡。但是不断引入新指标在总体上会弱化地方官员的激励。首先,引入一个新指标会冲击地方官员对原来指标的努力程度,原来的指标从设计者角度来说也同样非常重要。其次,新指标也可能是一个不易测度的方面,引入测度误差;再次,也是更关键的,当晋升指标越来越多的时候,地方官员就会无所适从;而新指标引入越多,政治锦标赛的组织者(如党委组织部门)就必须决定每个指标的权重,权重必然会有主观的成分,导致考核和评估过程越来越“主观化”,给予被考核者“寻租”的机会就会不断增加,使得一些地方官员不去努力工作,而是热心于“跑官卖官”。

[[9]](#part15.html_filepos1322795) 在民主国家,分权所面临的收益与成本权衡与集权体制完全不同,它主要由公共服务的质量和公共产品的覆盖范围两方面的因素决定。一方面,分权程度越高,地方政治家越容易监督,公众偏好信息越容易获取,使得公共服务的质量越高;但是,分权程度越大,适宜提供的公共产品的范围越小,而那些覆盖范围大的公共产品的提供激励不足,所以中央或比基层政府更高层级的政府需要提供收益覆盖范围大的公共产品。属地化行政发包制下地方政府的职责边界与民主体制有重大差别,公共产品的覆盖范围不是一个主要的考虑,信息、监督、激励与控制才是背后的主要考虑因素。

# 附录：政府内部的激励与治理理论

为了便于读者更好地理解本书讨论的内容,我们在此提供一个文献附录,对经济学的激励、组织与治理理论进行一些简要的介绍和说明。经济学的激励和治理理论虽然主要以企业和市场为研究对象,但它们的基本分析思路和方法经过一些适当的转换之后完全可以用来理解政府组织中的激励与治理问题,在这方面经济学已经取得了一些重要的进展。当然,经济学的激励与治理理论通常涉及大量的非常技术性的数学模型,这足以让大多数读者望而却步。不过,幸运的是,经济学的理论虽然建筑在严格的数学模型的基础之上,但它们所传递的理论直觉和见解却是相对简单的。本附录所要提供的理论背景就是这些易于理解的理论直觉,我们将运用非技术的语言对这些理论做一个通俗的说明。下面我们首先介绍与本书主题和内容密切相关的经济学的激励与治理理论,然后介绍这些理论在政府组织的应用。

## A.1 经济学的激励与治理理论

### A.1.1 激励理论

激励问题,最通俗的定义,就是如何调动人们的积极性的问题,比如企业经理如何调动工人工作的积极性,中央政府如何调动地方政府施政的积极性。激励问题也可以抽象地理解为委托人—代理人问题,即委托人(如企业经理和中央政府)把某项特定的任务或工作交给代理人(个人和地方政府)去完成,而任务和工作完成的好坏取决于代理人努力的程度。[^1] 从经济学的角度看,激励问题之所以产生有两个原因:一是委托人与代理人的目标不一致,企业经理可能关心的是利润,而工人关心的是薪酬和努力的成本,中央政府可能关心控制投资规模以维持物价稳定,而地方政府可能关心如何增加投资,刺激地方经济增长;二是委托人关于代理人努力程度的信息是不完全的,或者说关于代理人努力程度的信息分布是不对称的,代理人知道自己是否偷懒,而委托人则不太知道。

委托人和代理人的目标冲突和信息不对称这两者必须结合起来才能导致激励问题或委托—代理问题。首先,委托人和代理人之间必须存在一定的目标冲突,如果两者目标完全一致,那样不管信息分布如何不对称,代理人总会像关心自己的利益一样关心委托人的利益,那自然委托人就不用操心如何激励代理人的问题了。所以,一般说来,家族企业内部的授权所面临的委托—代理问题比公开上市公司要小一些,因为家族成员之间目标更倾向于一致。其次,如果代理人的行为可以完全被委托人观察到,代理人不掌握任何私人信息,那么激励问题的解决也非常简单:委托人只要根据代理人的努力程度给予相应的报酬就可以了。但是,如果委托人和代理人之间存在信息不对称,即委托人只能观测到代理人的产出,而不能确切地知道代理人究竟干了什么时,委托人与代理人的目标还不一致,激励问题就变得复杂了。从这个意义上说,激励问题产生于劳动分工、授权和信息的分散化。而任何一个组织,不管是企业组织还是政府组织,组织成员之间的劳动分工、授权和信息的分散化都是不可避免的事实,因此激励问题也就成为一个组织必须寻求解决的中心问题。

在现实生活中,有哪些办法来解决激励问题呢?下面我们对一些最基本的激励机制进行介绍。需要强调的是,我们在现实生活中所观察到的形形色色的激励手段都可以认为是下述基本激励工具的直接应用或某种搭配和变种。

#### 1. 激励契约

激励契约(incentive contracts)是委托人为了引导代理人更加努力工作而制定的契约,它将代理人的薪酬与代理人的业绩以某种方式联系起来。激励契约适用的环境是,虽然代理人的努力程度不能直接被委托人观察到,但其产出或绩效是可以观察的,且可以写入契约,即能够被第三方(如法庭)验证。代理人的产出是由代理人的努力和其他一些随机因素共同决定的。例如,一个销售经理的销售业绩一方面取决于他的努力程度,另一方面也和他不能控制的市场因素有关。

现实中的激励契约通常由两个部分组成,其中一部分规定了代理人可以取得的固定报酬,相当于基本工资,它与代理人的具体业绩无关,而另一部分规定了和代理人产出相关的报酬支付方案。委托人在设计这样一个激励契约时需要考虑两个约束条件:第一个约束条件是让代理人出于自身利益的计算愿意接受这项契约,这也叫“参与约束”;第二个约束条件是,委托人在设计激励契约时所期望的代理人的努力程度必须是代理人在激励契约下最优选择的努力水平,这也叫“激励兼容约束”。

至于代理人的报酬如何与产出挂钩,是激励契约设计的难点所在。从理论上讲,激励契约设计可以是高度复杂的。但是在实际的生活中,我们看到的激励契约往往是线性的,也就是说,报酬的计算往往是和工作成果呈正的线性关系,例如“分成租佃制”“计件工资制”等,从本质上来讲,都是线性的激励契约。霍姆斯特罗姆和米尔格罗姆在一篇论文中曾经论述了在满足一些条件时,线性激励契约可以达到最优的激励效果,这解释了线性契约广泛存在的合理性(Holmstrom and Milgrom,1987)。

假定委托人是风险中性的(即对于风险既不喜爱也不厌恶),而代理人是风险规避的,那么,在线性契约的框架下,关于代理人的报酬如何与其产出挂钩,委托人必须考虑一系列因素,如代理人厌恶风险的程度,代理人努力水平对于产出的影响程度等等。这里委托人面临的最基本的权衡是效率与风险分担的矛盾。从激励代理人努力工作的角度出发,委托人应该尽量把代理人的报酬与绩效挂钩,挂钩程度越高,代理人的努力程度越高,从而增加效率。但是另一方面,当代理人的报酬与绩效挂钩程度不断提高,势必使代理人的报酬波动性加大,对于风险规避的代理人来说,其效用损失也随之增大,由于委托人不怕风险,所以从风险分担的角度看,又应该尽量把风险让委托人承担,让代理人的报酬尽量固定化。最优的激励契约就是在效率和风险分担之间寻求一种最优的平衡。根据一些具体情况,我们可以得到一些比较有启发性的结论。

第一,如果产出对于代理人的努力程度依赖性很强,或者说,代理人对产出的控制能力较强,那么就应该给予代理人较强的激励,也就是说,代理人的报酬与产出的挂钩程度可以加大。反过来,如果产出和代理人的努力程度关联度不大,给予过强的激励只会让代理人承担不必要的风险。

第二,如果产出受到的外在随机因素的干扰较大,导致产出有很大的不确定性,那么对于代理人就应该给予较弱的激励。举个极端的例子,在一个完全“靠天吃饭”的环境里,即使代理人努力工作也很可能一无所获。在这种情况下,将报酬和产出紧密挂钩显然是不合适的。相反,采用较弱的激励,如固定工资制,可能是更为可取的。同样,如果代理人的绩效不容易测度和衡量,给予代理人的激励强度也应降低,因为此时测度误差就像随机扰动因素一样对规避风险的代理人来说是一种效用损失。这可以解释在企业内部销售部门员工的报酬一般与其销售绩效挂钩程度较高,而财务部门则更可能采取固定工资制(有奖金也是固定的或者企业平均的奖金),原因在于销售部门的绩效显然比财务部门的绩效更容易测度。我们后面还会讨论到,为什么相对于企业来说,政府内部通常采取固定薪酬制,而不采取固定工资加奖金制,一个重要原因是相对来说政府部门的产出难以准确衡量。

第三,如果代理人规避风险的倾向较为严重,那么应该给予其较弱的激励。由于产出会受到一些随机因素的影响,所以代理人的努力和产出并不是一一对应的关系。如果给予代理人强激励,即将产出和报酬紧密联系,那就相当于让代理人承担了更多的额外风险,这对于非常厌恶风险的代理人来说是不利的安排。

第四,如果代理人对于激励的反应很灵敏,那么应该给予其较强的激励。这一点是很显然的:在其他条件相同的情况下,能力强的代理人应该给予更高的激励强度。

在现实中,我们经常会看到,委托人同时将相同或类似的任务交给了多个代理人去完成,例如,一个公司有多个销售员,每个人负责一个市场的销售,从事的工作和环境非常相似。在中国各个地方政府负责其管辖范围内的经济社会发展,地方政府从事的工作和环境非常接近。在这种情况下,委托人可以采用相对绩效评估(relative performance evaluation)的方式设计每个代理人的激励契约,从而实现比绝对绩效评估下更高的激励效果。此时代理人所能够得到的报酬就不仅取决于自身的工作业绩,也取决于其他代理人的工作业绩。

这种相对绩效考评广泛存在的原因是:每个代理人的工作业绩除了受到自身努力水平和某些特有因素的影响之外,还会受到一些共同干扰因素的影响。因此每个代理人自身的努力水平不仅通过其自身的工作成果得到局部的反映,其他代理人的工作业绩也将包含着这个代理人努力程度的信息。还以销售人员为例:销售人员的工作业绩不佳可能是由于自身努力不够引起的,也可能是由于市场需求不旺引起的。如果所有销售人员的销售业绩都普遍较低,那么就表明市场的整体需求可能过低,销售业绩不佳不应归咎于销售员;而如果其他销售员的业绩都较高,那么市场需求不旺的可能性就很小,业绩不佳就更可能是由销售员自身工作不努力造成的。因此,在设计激励契约时把其他代理人的平均绩效考虑进来,有助于剔除一些共同因素的干扰,对代理人的努力水平形成更准确的估计,相当于减少了测度代理人绩效的误差水平。

但是,这样的相对绩效考核也有一些不足。比如,代理人为了提高自己工作成果的相对水平,可能会故意对其他代理人的工作进行干扰破坏。Holmstrom(1982)提出了一种解决方案,即将代理人的报酬至少部分和所有代理人的平均工作业绩挂钩,这样就可以较好地抑制代理人的互相破坏行为。

在相对绩效评估中,有一种非常特殊的激励设计,那就是锦标赛(tournament)激励。根据Lazear和Rosen(1981),锦标赛的主要特征是,完全根据各代理人的业绩的相对排名,而不是他们业绩的绝对值来支付代理人的报酬,并且奖励额度是事先设定的。一般而言,不同名次的代理人获得的支付相差会很大,这主要是为了保证所有的代理人都有激励参与其中——所谓“重赏之下,必有勇夫”,就是这个意思。锦标赛在体育比赛中是非常普遍的激励方式,它在企业和政府组织中也有广泛的应用,比如职位竞争就如同锦标赛一样,只有竞争的优胜者获得职位晋升。前面我们详细讨论过的我国地方官员激励制度之一就是政治锦标赛模式,即统一级别的地方官员之间围绕着地区经济增长而相互竞争,以求获得政治晋升的机会。

锦标赛激励有很多优点:第一,锦标赛可以对代理人造成较为有效的激励。和一般的相对绩效考评一样,锦标赛模型可以排除公共因素对于工作绩效的影响,从而较好地对代理人进行激励。此外,根据Lazear和Rosen(1981),如果代理人的风险偏好是中性的,那么锦标赛甚至可以达到最优的激励。第二,锦标赛激励具有良好的事前承诺性质。根据Malcomson(1984),由于锦标赛中各个名次的奖励是事先给定的,因此无论谁最终获胜、成绩为多少,委托人都不会有额外的成本,因此委托人一般不会改变事前对于奖励的承诺。第三,相对于其他的激励方案而言,锦标赛的激励方案是比较容易设计,同时又比较容易操作的,界定优胜者相对比较简单。

但是,锦标赛激励也可能存在一些不足:第一,如果不同参赛者的能力相差太大,那么能力较弱的参赛者就可能选择放弃参赛,而能力强的参赛人也不用太努力也可获胜,这样将会大大影响代理人的激励。第二,如果获胜的诱惑过于巨大,那么参赛人在除了加大自身的努力之外,还可能会选择对其他参赛人的成绩进行破坏,出现“拆台”的动机,而这显然不符合委托人的根本利益。第7章讨论了我国区域经济互动中经常出现的恶性竞争和地方保护主义的种种现象,这些现象和政治锦标赛下地方官员的“拆台”动机密切相关。

到现在为止,我们讨论的问题都隐含了一个假设,即委托人交给代理人的任务是单一的。但是,在现实中,代理人需要完成的任务可能是多方面的,或者任务要达成的目标是多维的。例如,在大学里,教师同时承担着两个基本任务——教学和科研;再如,企业的很多工作有“保质”和“保量”的双重要求,这些都是多任务委托—代理问题(multitask principal-agent problem)的体现。

当代理人面临多个任务,且各个任务业绩的可考核程度存在差异时,代理人就有可能将所有的努力都花到业绩较容易被观察的任务上,而减少或完全放弃在其他任务上的努力。例如,政府的官员面临着促进经济发展、推动社会进步、加强文化建设等多项任务,但是由于社会进步、文化建设等指标很难考察,所以在官员的政绩考核中经济建设往往会被视为唯一标准。因此在现实中我们经常看到官员十分重视经济建设这个易于被考察的指标,而对于社会、文化等方面的建设任务就显得漠不关心了。这就是多任务下容易出现的激励扭曲的问题。

根据Holmstrom和Milgrom(1991),应对上面这种激励扭曲的一个办法是,对于较容易观察业绩的任务也采用弱化的激励,即将代理人的报酬与容易观测绩效的关系减弱,这样可以使代理人在多个任务之间较为平衡地分配努力。一个现实的例子是大学里对于科研奖励的刻意淡化。由于相对于教学,科研成果是相对容易考核的,因此如果给予科研成果以很高的奖励,就会使大学教师只重科研,而完全轻视教学。因此,对科研成果奖励的刻意淡化事实上是促使教师在科研和教学之间合理分配精力的一种策略。我们还可以看到,企业内部销售部门的奖金虽然与销售绩效挂钩,但挂钩程度也有一定限度,一个原因是销售部门除了增加销量之外,还需要向工程和研发部门反馈消费者对产品的评价,与其他部门密切合作,而合作的意愿和成效相对不容易测度。如果奖金完全与销售业绩挂钩,销售经理就会偏重本部门的销量指标而看轻跨部门的合作。多任务下采取弱激励的方式也可以解释为什么政府部门倾向于采用固定报酬制,因为政府部门属于典型的多任务的工作性质,有些维度的任务业绩相对容易测度,有些则很难衡量。

#### 2. 效率工资理论

所谓“效率工资”是指对员工支付高于市场工资水平的一种激励策略。这种激励策略早在20世纪初福特公司就曾经实践过。在1914年,福特公司开始向其工人支付每小时5美元的工资,而当时汽车制造工人的工资水平一般在每小时2—3美元。在福特实行了这项工资后,工人们的劳动积极性被很好地调动起来,偷懒、缺勤等问题大为下降、生产率大为上升。最终,这项看似会提高成本、降低利润的工资方案却为福特公司大大压缩了成本,很好地提高了利润。

关于效率工资为何能够提高工人的工作效率,经济学界有很多种解释:

第一种理论认为,工资影响营养。多支付工人工资,工人才吃得起营养更丰富的食物,而健康的工人生产效率更高。这是效率工资最早的理论版本。

第二种理论是由Shapiro和Stiglitz(1984)提出的。这种理论认为,工人可以选择是否努力工作,而企业不可能完全监督工人的努力程度,这里引起了工人的道德风险问题。委托人虽然无法直接观察代理人的努力程度,但通过投入一定的监督成本,在一定的概率下可以发现代理人是否偷懒。工人一旦被发现偷懒就会被解雇,失去高于市场的工资意味着对工人偷懒的惩罚。高于市场工资的部分对于工人来说既是激励,也是潜在的惩罚,就像抵押品一样,只要工人努力工作,抵押品就一直属于工人所有,一旦偷懒就可能失去。因此效率工资有助于减少工人的道德风险,提高工人的努力程度,进而提高工人效率,最终提高企业的利润。这是目前主流文献中关于效率工资理论的最流行的解释。

第三种理论认为,高素质的工人会有更高的保留工资,因此高工资能够吸引更多高素质的工人,从而提高工人的平均素质和生产率水平。有关这种观点的详细论述可以参考Weiss(1980)。

第四种理论认为高工资可以培养工人对企业的忠诚度,从而将使他们工作更为努力,并因此使工作效率得以提高。在这里,高于市场的工资可以理解为是企业给予员工的礼物,而员工也以更高的努力水平回报企业,高工资与高努力成为企业内部经理与员工的礼物交换。

需要强调的是,效率工资作为一种激励方式与激励契约的区别在于,前者不需要将工资与工人的绩效挂钩,也不需要工人的绩效可以观察和量度,更不需要第三方(如法庭)介入来实施这个契约。应该说,效率工资理论对于企业和政府组织都很有借鉴作用。例如,所谓的政府部门的“高薪养廉”在很大程度上就是夏皮罗(Shapiro)和斯蒂格利兹(Stiglitz)的效率工资理论的直接翻版,它在中国香港地区、新加坡等地非常流行,对于约束公务人员的贪腐行为也非常有效。当然,我们也需要注意到,在夏皮罗和斯蒂格利兹的理论中,高工资是和监督体系、惩罚力度密不可分的。如果没有有效的监督和严厉的惩罚,高薪养廉就要打一个大大的问号了。

#### 3. 职业前景理论

法玛(Fama)在1980年的一篇论文中提出,在企业内部,委托—代理问题似乎没有想象中的严重。只要存在一个有效的职业经理人市场,公司的经理为了确立自己在市场上的声誉就会有充分的激励努力工作。Holmstrom(1999)在法玛工作的基础上,提出了职业前景(career concerns)理论。霍姆斯特罗姆认为,经理人工作的回报不仅来自于现在获得的工资,而且更多地来自于其将来的升迁和被其他公司雇用的机会。需要说明的是,职业前景可以给经理人带来足够的激励的前提是存在一个有效运作的经理人市场。市场上的潜在的雇主无法知道经理的内在能力,只能根据观察到的经理的业绩表现推断其潜在的能力,进而决定需要开出的价码。在这一条件得到满足时,经理人为了给潜在的雇主创造一个好的印象,说明自己是一个高能力的经理,就会努力工作,尽量表现,即使当前所能获得的报酬较低,也会为了将来获得更好的工作机会和报酬而努力工作。根据霍姆斯特罗姆的理论,职业前景对于刚刚步入职业生涯的年轻人是最能起到激励作用的。这些新人刚刚出道,其能力、水平都不为人所知,所能向市场表现的空间是最大的,在这个意义上,这些新人有着最为广阔的职业发展空间,将来事业的前景能带给他们的激励将会远远高于现有的工资激励。而相反的,对于一个工作经历丰富的人,其工作能力已经被外界充分了解,再也不需要、也不可能通过努力工作来表现自己了,所以对这些人而言职业前景激励的作用就会相对较小。

职业前景理论虽然看似简单,但是它可以帮助我们解释日常所见的一些不能用传统理论解释的问题。一个例子是,现实中大量存在所谓无薪实习的现象。根据传统的激励契约理论,这一现象很难得到解释,而根据职业前景理论这种状况就得以理解了。职业前景理论特别适合解释政府官员的激励和行为。一个大家所熟知的例子是所谓的“新官上任三把火”。为什么新官上任后都要“放三把火”,而老官却很少积极表现呢?因为新官需要通过“放三把火”好好表现一番,给上级留下一个好印象,为以后晋升创造机会,而老官则无须表现了。为什么同样是新官上任,又会出现“萧规曹随”的情况呢?因为曹参接替萧何为丞相时虽然是履新,但已不是什么真正意义上的新官,而是朝中老臣,自然不需要“放三把火”来表现自己了。

职业前景理论可以为我们分析地方官员的激励和国家人事政策的影响提供一个独特的视角。中国改革开放以来在干部人事管理制度上最引人注目的政策是干部年轻化。为什么干部年轻化如此重要?仅仅是因为年轻人精力充沛和思想活跃吗?职业前景理论告诉我们,年轻人和老年人的人力资本的差别只是一方面,更主要的是两者激励结构的差别。一个刚刚涉足仕途的年轻人和一个临近退休的老年人在同样的职位上所面临的激励和机会是很不一样的,让年轻人可以担纲重要的职位,这些被选任的年轻人的职业前景激励较年老的人要强烈得多。当然,这一政策也同时会造成一些负面效果:干部年轻化使得年龄较大的干部的职业前景缩短了,因此可能降低他们努力工作的激励,甚至使一些干部滋生“升官无望,不如在任上捞一把”的想法,从而可能导致腐败的上升。我们在后面会详细讨论干部年轻化的得失问题。但从这些简单的分析就可以看出,干部人事制度的设计和调整背后必须考虑诸多因素,其中激励问题特别值得注意。

### A.1.2 企业组织与治理

经济学有一个核心的问题吸引了许多经济学家的注意力,那就是,为什么会有企业存在?为什么企业内部的交易不能全部放在市场上完成?这个问题涉及企业组织的边界问题,首先由科斯在《企业的性质》一文中提出,自此之后,企业理论就一直围绕着如何解答这个问题而不断发展。科斯当时给出的解答是交易费用,即利用市场机制实现交易所需要的费用,比如搜寻价格的费用、讨价还价的费用等等,而企业内部关系的核心特征是行政指令,以行政指令为基础的配置方式相比市场交易而言可以节约交易费用,因而获得了相对于市场的“比较优势”。如果企业组织可以节约交易费用,那为什么不把所有的市场交易都放在企业内部进行呢?科斯又引入了管理费用的概念,认为当企业规模不断扩大时管理费用会随之上升,最后在边际交易上节约的交易费用与增加的管理费用相平衡,企业的最优规模和边界就形成了(Coase,1937)。

科斯所提出的交易费用概念开启了经济学研究企业组织的全新视角,是后来所有企业理论的一个基石,其重要性不言而喻。然而,交易费用概念如果只停留在利用市场机制的成本这个水平上,则有过于宽泛和笼统之嫌,难以具体应用。我们需要知道决定交易费用的因素是什么,交易费用如何依交易物品的特性和交易环境而发生变化。鉴于交易费用概念的局限性,威廉姆森(Williamson,1975)提出了一个具有可操作性和可预测性的交易费用经济学。

威廉姆森秉承科斯开创的分析视角,把交易作为分析的基本单位。他考察的核心问题是,什么因素决定交易费用的大小,进而决定一笔交易是在市场上完成还是在企业内部完成?威廉姆森认为,交易费用由三个维度的因素决定:一是有限理性,人们对未来可能发生的状况所知有限,这决定了人们不可能在签订契约时把未来所有可能发生的状态都写入契约,签订一个完备契约(complete contract)是不可能的;二是机会主义倾向,即人们不仅自私自利,有时还不信守承诺,甚至乘人之危,谋取不当利益;三是资产专用性,即资产专用于某个特定目的的程度。投资专用性越强,事后就越可能被沉没,因而被交易另一方敲竹杠的(hold-up)可能性越大。[^2] 有限理性和资产专用性对交易费用的影响取决于具体交易的物品和交易环境。如果交易的产品属于比较标准的商品,涉及的资产专用性小,市场类似的供应也比较多,那么交易内容很容易写入契约,即使交易对方处于机会主义动机而反悔、违约,也可转向一般市场购买,因而交易费用比较低,这一类的交易在市场上完成的可能性大。反过来,如果交易商品技术上比较复杂(如大型专用设备),完成此项交易还需花费一笔可观的专用性投入(如专门化的技术培训和配套设备的研发和生产),此时有限理性和资产专用性问题的威胁就显得较为严重了。首先交易契约无法对商品的性能进行详尽规定,只能签订一个非完备契约;其次,购买方还需投入大量的专用于此项交易的投资,可能成为对方胁迫和敲竹杠的“资本”。在这种情况下,一旦契约未尽事态出现了,对方的机会主义动机加上资产专用性就会让购买方利益严重受损。也就是说,这一类交易如果交给市场去完成,面临的交易费用就可能很高,因此某种区别于市场的某种组织安排或者是治理结构(governance structure),如长期契约、企业联盟或企业自己生产,就会出现,代替单纯的现货交易(spot-market transaction)。这些非市场的治理结构可以对专用性投资进行事后的保护,防止机会主义行为对事前投资的不利影响。

从上面的例子可以看出,交易的具体特性(如产品或服务的复杂性、涉及的投资专用性程度、未来的变动性和不确定性等等)决定了有限理性、机会主义倾向和资产专用性对交易费用的影响程度,进而决定了交易所需的治理结构的最优选择。治理结构包括市场现货交易、长期契约、企业联盟、企业内部生产、政府组织等等各种组织形式。威廉姆森认为,任何一种经济组织的治理结构,其设计都是为了实现节约交易费用的目的,而交易的特性与交易的治理结构之间存在一种严格的对应关系,不同特性的交易催生不同的治理结构,这种对应关系背后的关键性因素是有限理性、机会主义和资产专用性。如果我们看到类似的交易在不同的制度环境下采取了不同的交易治理结构,那么,我们必须去具体分析这些交易特性如何与交易人所在的制度环境发生了互动关系,导致了不同的治理结构的选择。

现在大家所熟悉的“治理”一词就来自于威廉姆森的交易费用经济学,其基本内涵是使交易费用最小化的组织设计和制度安排。“治理”更进一步的含义是有效应对委托—代理问题的组织安排。当然,它在不同的场合可能包含不同的具体内涵,比如公司治理是指股东、董事会、经理等利益相关人(stakeholders)之间的委托—代理关系所导致的组织安排,而“政府治理”则是指公民、政治家、政府官员之间的委托—代理关系所导致的组织安排。“治理”也可以推广到政府与企业的交易关系,即在什么样的司法、行政体制下政府能够向潜在的投资者提供可信和安全的产权保护。

威廉姆森的交易费用经济学强调在机会主义和有限理性的前提下交易的复杂性和不确定性所带来的交易风险,而资产专用性则更加剧了事后被胁迫和敲竹杠的危险。所以,任何涉及大量个体间交易的组织必须寻求适当的治理结构来防范这些交易风险,降低事后被胁迫和敲竹杠的危险,从而节约交易费用。而治理结构设计的一个核心问题是如何为事前的专用性投资提供可信的承诺(credible commitment)和事后保护。

威廉姆森的交易费用经济学(有时称之为新制度主义经济学)有着非常广泛和深刻的寓意,能够被用来解析许多经济组织现象,比如企业一体化、现代公司的组织形式从U型到M型结构的转变以及公司治理结构(如债权与股权的区别、家族企业与非家族企业的区别)的决定。下面我们仅以现代公司形式从U型到M型结构的转变为例,看看交易费用经济学如何帮助我们理解企业组织的变化。

U型组织和M型组织的说法,最早是由美国的企业史大师钱德勒(Alfred Chandler)在其著作《战略与结构:美国工业企业史的若干篇章》中提出的(Chandler,1962)。在这部著作中,钱德勒将当时的企业形式分成了三种类型,即单一型(unitary form)、控股型(holding form)和多事业部型(multidivisional form),也就是我们后来熟悉的U型、H型和M型。U型企业的特点是,权力集中于总部,企业根据功能分工的原则划分为不同职能部门,如采购、生产、研发、营销和财务等,总部依靠这些职能部门垂直控制各业务单元。H型企业则正好和U型企业相反,它类似于一个松散的企业联盟。M型企业正好是前两者的一个结合,它根据不同产品或地区建立不同的事业部,授予事业部领导人在本事业部业务范围内协调各职能部门的工作、组织产品开发和生产、进行产品营销的全权,同时对盈利负责。各事业部成为相对独立的利润中心。从20世纪20年代以来美国的大公司逐渐从传统的U型结构过渡到M型结构的组织形式。通过对大量案例的分析,钱德勒认为,M型企业更加适合企业多元化扩张战略的需要。

威廉姆森沿用了钱德勒的提法,也在自己的研究中把组织分为了U型、H型和M型。根据交易费用经济学的观点,威廉姆森认为从U型结构向M型结构的转变有其必然性。随着企业规模的扩大,产品种类的增加,企业的管理与决策变得日益复杂,U型结构下公司总部需要处理从日常管理决策到长期战略规划等各种事宜,给定经理人员的有限理性,最后必然陷入过度负荷的状态。而M型组织有助于实现信息沟通和决策负担的下放,使总部可以专注于公司战略性和长期性的重大决策,在有限理性的范围内节省了成本。不仅如此,M型组织还能弱化原来U型组织下各部门只追求部门利益的机会主义倾向。因为战略决策权还留在公司总部手中,这就减少公司内部资源配置过程中的派系之争,使资源在公司各事业部之间实现有效配置。而且,总办公室掌握了内部审计和控制的技术,也有利于克服信息沟通的阻力,使它能够更有效地控制经营部门。

钱颖一和许成钢(Qian and Xu, 1993)利用了U型组织和M型组织的概念比较了中国和苏联的改革。在这篇富有影响的论文中,钱颖一和许成钢认为,苏联的计划经济接近于一个U型结构,其计划管理是垂直的、纵向的,各加盟共和国的经济更接近于专业化分工的关系;而在改革前的中国,计划经济采用的是一种M型结构,存在着结构和功能类似的多层次和多地区管理结构,地方政府拥有自己管理的工业,省区之间经济相对独立。根据钱和许的论述,U型结构在利用规模经济、实行专业化方面相对于M型结构有着优势,这是苏联工业一度高度发达的原因之一。但是U型结构的缺点在于难以应对复杂的经济环境。而在此时,M型结构在信息处理上的低成本性、应对外界反应的灵活性,以及在进行制度试验方面的可控性等优势就凸显出来。M型组织在这些方面的优势是解释中国改革成功,而苏联改革失败的一个重要原因。马斯金、钱颖一和许成钢(Maskin, Qian and Xu, 2000)一文尝试了用激励的观点来论述M型组织的优势:由于M型组织中,各事业部之间有很高的相似性,因此公司总部可以让各部门进行标杆竞争来更好地激励事业部经理。

在威廉姆森企业理论的基础之上,三位经济学家格罗斯曼、哈特和穆尔(下面简称GHM)发展了一种关于企业的产权理论,试图更系统、更清晰地界定企业组织的性质和边界(Grossman and Hart,1986;Hart and Moore,1990)。在他们的理论中,企业被设想为一种非人力资产的组合,人们按照一个事前签订的契约来控制这些资产。和威廉姆森一样,GHM假定人们不可能事先签订一个完备的契约,即穷尽一切未来可能发生的事态及可能的应对,只能签订不完备契约(incomplete contract)。另外,在GHM理论中,资产专用性也是一个非常重要的理论环节。

GHM理论在威廉姆森理论的基础上引入了产权这个核心概念,“产权”被定义为对于企业非人力资产的剩余控制权(residual control rights)。所谓“剩余控制权”,就是契约上载明的权利之外的所有权力,即一旦发生了契约上没有提及的情况,那么拥有产权的一方有权按照自己的意志,对资产进行自由处置。如果事前签订的契约是不完备的,而交易双方又需要进行事前的专用性投资,那么产权的初始配置就变得非常关键,因为产权作为对投资资产的剩余控制权可以保护其部分价值,从而影响到事前进行专用性投资的激励。我们举个例子对此加以说明:假设企业1生产一种中间产品,卖给企业2,企业2为了更有效地利用这个中间产品需要事前进行一些专用性的投资,这些投资可以大幅度节省使用中间投入品的成本。如果这两个企业相互独立,各自拥有自己的产权,那么,企业2就没有足够的激励从事事前的专用性投资,担心一旦投入之后,企业1可能趁机敲竹杠,导致企业2利益受损。企业2不从事专用性投资从社会角度看是有效率损失的。如果假定企业2兼并企业1,也就是说,企业2同时拥有了原先两个企业物质资产的产权,那么,企业2就有充分的激励从事专用性投资,增进资源配置的效率。在这里产权所覆盖的物质资产决定了企业的边界,产权的意义在于鼓励专用性投资的激励。

在经济领域之外,剩余控制权的配置也起着重要作用。以政府制定的政策法规为例,其条文往往是比较笼统的。这时,遇到政策法规的条文没有涉及的问题时,谁有权进行解释,就是一个关键的问题。而政府经常将政策法规保持一种笼统和模糊的状态,旨在保有最后相机决定的剩余控制权。在我国改革开放的早期,政策法规的解释权是集中在政府一方的,因此人们在从事创新性的活动,如成立新的企业、引入新的经营方式时,往往会有所顾忌,生怕政府会宣布这些行为非法而加以取缔。而在政府规定“法无明文规定即允许”之后,人们在从事创新性的活动时的顾虑就被打消了,可以预见这种对政策解释权的配置的变动必然会促进人们从事创新活动的积极性。在改革之初,中央赋予广东和福建进行改革开放探索的自主权,提出对中央部门的指令和要求采取灵活态度,适合的就执行,不适合的就可以不执行或变通执行。这等于给予了广东和福建省政府改革的剩余控制权。

GHM的产权理论也可以应用到组织内部授权的研究。在一个组织内部,经常看到上级把一些决策权下放给下属部门或个人。从激励和组织设计的角度看,决策权在上级领导和下属手中有什么真正的区别呢?如果我们认为为了做出一个好的决策,必须花费一些投入,如收集信息、集思广益、认真思考和权衡,那么,决策权的归属就决定了决策投入的收益是否受到保护。如果决策权在上级,下属对于做出一个好的决策的激励就会下降,因为他(她)辛辛苦苦提出的决策建议可能被否决,而如果决策权下放给了下属,那么下属不用担心上级会出面否决,决策的收益得到了保护,因而认真决策的激励也就随之提高。所以权力下放有助于增加下级部门决策和行动的激励。当然,权力下放对于上级来说也会存在失控的危险,因为下属也许会把决策权用在增进其私人利益的用途而对组织利益构成损害(Aghion and Tirole,1997)。决策的激励角度可以帮助我们理解组织内授权和政府分权的现象。

把企业作为一种治理结构,除了威廉姆森强调的资产专用性和GHM强调的产权的特征,近年来经济学家开始强调治理结构是一种激励系统。Milgrom和Roberts(1990),Holmstrom和Milgrom(1994)以及Holmstrom(1999)把治理模式视为一种激励系统,认为治理结构由一系列组织要素(激励和约束工具)组成,如物质资产所有权、激励契约、任务分配和限制,不再是简单的科层组织与市场治理的区别,或者简单依据物质资产所有权的分配进行划分的治理模式。该理论的一个核心概念是互补性,认为各组织要素之间通常是互补的,即增加一种要素的强度会提高增加另一种要素使用强度的边际收益,而整体的组织绩效则由这些互补的组织要素之间的共同作用来决定。[^3] 由此可以引出两个基本的推论:(1)这些最优选定的组织要素之间必然是内在一致的(coherent)系统,所以当外部参数发生变化时,这些组织要素的最优值会发生系统和一致的变化(比如一同上升或下降);(2)最优的组织治理模式可能是多样化的,每个模式内部自成一体,但如果只从一个最优组织中抽取某些要素嫁接到另一个优化组织,则可能会损害组织的一致性,从而降低组织绩效。

Bernheim和Whinston(1990)的关联博弈(linked game)理论也含有激励互补性的性质,即如果博弈参与人同时参与两个博弈,那么,即使单个博弈下参与人的激励约束不满足,关联的两个博弈同时进行则可以使之更容易满足。Aoki(1988,1990,2001)从互补性理论出发对日本与美国企业治理的模式进行比较,发现日本企业内部部门之间横向的信息分享(信息分权)与垂直的人事控制(人事集权)是内在互补的安排,而美国企业则是垂直的信息交流(信息集权)和横向的人事管理(人事分权)优势互补的结构,并进一步强调了制度的多样性及动态演化过程。

## A.2 政府组织中的激励与治理

从传统的观点看,关于政府治理有两个基本问题:第一个问题是,政府职能的有效边界在哪里?换句话说,哪些事情属于政府管辖或直接供应的范围?哪些应该交给市场?第二个问题,政府公共部门应该采取怎样的治理结构?政府官员应该面临怎样的激励方式?从现在的眼光看,这两个问题其实是紧密联系在一起的,政府职能的有效边界和公共部门的治理结构是相互作用和联合决定的。

关于政府职能的边界,传统的观点认为,凡是市场失效的领域(如公共产品供应、企业垄断、外在性问题等),政府都应该干预,或者政府直接管理和经营,比如政府直接经营的公共企业直接提供社会需要的公共产品,如国防、邮政、铁路、司法、市政工程等,或者政府设立专门的管制机关对企业进行监管。

后来一些经济学家(如施蒂格勒)尤其是公共选择学派的经济学家(如布坎南)提出,政府干预也会带来政府失效问题,比如企业的寻租行为导致政府官员被捕获、官员腐败、行政效率低下等等。即使存在市场失效的情形,如果政府失效非常严重,那还不如减少甚至取消政府干预,从社会福利角度看,其结果也许比政府干预还要更好。所以政府职能边界的确定必须结合市场失效和政府失效两个方面的综合权衡。

其实,关于政府组织的边界问题也可以在科斯和威廉姆森提出的交易费用经济学的框架下进行思考。按照他们的观点,相对于一个原子式的自由竞争市场,企业的起源是利用市场机制的成本,即交易费用,但企业的最终边界(即企业的最优规模)取决于企业治理成本和交易费用的比较。沿着相同的思路,我们可以问:政府治理的边界又在哪里?政府职能范围的决定因素是什么呢?从技术角度看,政府行政治理的边界应该与地方公共产品的有效覆盖范围大致一致,但这只是问题的一个方面,就像我们不能根据企业生产技术的规模经济的有效范围定义企业的边界一样,我们不能只根据公共产品的覆盖范围确立政府职能的边界。它必然要和行政治理成本相联系。那么,什么决定行政治理成本?行政治理成本来自行政组织内部对于政府雇员、对于上下级政府之间的关系的治理成本,它的核心是政府官员的激励未能与委托人的利益协调一致的问题,也即在政治领域中的委托—代理问题。因此,设计一个合理的行政治理结构将有助于规范政府官员的激励,从而降低这些交易费用。

行政治理的边界和最优政府层级的设计除了涉及传统意义上的地方公共产品的溢出效应、地方民众的偏好显示(用脚投票)和信息分散等维度以外,还必须考虑到政府失效问题,如政府间关系的不可置信的承诺问题、预算软约束问题、集权体制下官员晋升竞争的负面影响问题、行政权力的滥用、寻租倾向等等,这些均构成行政治理的成本。

在任何社会,政府官员或政治家最终都是关心仕途和晋升,差别只在于决定政治仕途的具体机制不同而已。就这个意义而言,治理官员的核心是如何将政治家(政府官员)的政治仕途与反映社会需求的一定标准相联系。经济学家最近在反思“华盛顿共识”,有一些经济学家提出“制度共识”“把激励搞对”(Easterly,2005)。我们可以进一步提出“把政府官员的激励搞对”,因为这是政府治理的核心。

Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)利用不完备契约理论对政府组织的职能范围进行了分析。公共服务(如监狱管理、收集垃圾、国防武器的生产等)可以由政府自己提供,也可以外包给市场提供。无论是政府还是私人部门提供,都需要考虑两个问题,即公共服务的成本和质量。如果政府直接提供公共服务,那么就要雇用一批公务员来工作;而如果政府将一些公共服务交给一些私人部门,那么政府只要和相关的私人部门签订一个契约,而由私人部门出面雇用员工来从事这些工作。如果政府和私人部门可以订立完全的契约,也就是将需要的质量、成本要求,面对各种可能发生事件应采取的应对方案等等事宜一一说明,那么无论是由政府直接提供服务,还是让私人部门提供服务将能够产生相同的效果。但问题在于,契约一般是很难是完备的,尤其是在诸如对外政策、公安、国防等部门,其服务质量难以衡量,并且在面对不同的情况时需要完全不同的服务方案。在契约不能订立完备的情况下,究竟是谁拥有剩余所有权,即谁能决定对契约没有涉及的情况的处理方法就显得很重要了。一般来说,作为私人部门,会更重视成本节约问题,所以它们更加乐于钻契约的空子,从契约所没有提及的内容里挖掘出对于自己有利的方案,尽力减少提供服务的成本;而对于政府而言,其主要关心的内容则是公共服务的质量,而对成本的考虑则会较少。在此基础之上,Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)提出了一个政府职能范围的标准,即如果那些不可被契约明确表示的内容对于服务质量影响不大的话,那么就应该将这些服务交给私人部门来提供;而如果不可被契约明确表示的内容有可能严重影响服务质量的话,那么政府就应该选择直接提供这些公共服务。根据这个标准,Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)认为,诸如外交、公安、国防等服务应该由政府直接提供,而像垃圾收集、武器制造等服务,则可以交给私人部门完成。

Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)把政府的边界理解为一个类似于企业边界的问题,即政府需要计算一项公共服务是由政府提供还是从市场上购买,并且利用GHM的产权理论从不完备契约、产权和投资激励保护的角度考察政府供应与市场供应的相对得失,这为我们思考政府的边界提供了一个很有启发意义的视角。

鉴于中国政府组织的特征,基于行政发包制的理论,笔者给出了一个不同于Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)的关于政府边界的定义(周黎安,2016)。笔者认为,政府组织的边界是由官僚组织内部上下级职位系列的晋升链条所决定。自下而上的晋升链条断于何处,官僚制就止于何处,晋升链条的最顶端定义了行政组织的最高权威,晋升链条的最底端定义了行政组织的边界。如果不同的官员有机会晋升到更高的同一层级,则这些官员就同属一个官僚组织。在行政发包制当中引入行政晋升机制,我们就可以明确定义作为政府内部关系的行政发包制的边界。晋升序列既定义了权力层级的等级结构,也定义了行政内包与外包的边界。一个代理人如果处于某个官僚组织的晋升序列,他就是在这个组织的边界之内;如果他与该官僚组织有交易或合作关系,但不在官僚组织的晋升序列之中,就说明他处于正式官僚组织之外,与官僚组织发生交易或外包关系。区分行政内包与外包的关键是承包人是否在官僚组织的晋升序列之中。

以晋升序列作为识别政府组织边界的标准,区别于Hart、Shleifer和Vishny(1997)所强调的资产所有权的标准,便于准确认识中国官僚组织的边界。我们知道,明清时期官吏分途,胥吏虽然从事政府事务,但没有晋升希望,被排除在正式的官僚体制之外,从官至吏由行政内包走向了行政外包的关系。胥吏虽活动于“官衙之内”,但事实上处在“体制之外”,即“官场之外”,属于政府事务的外部承包人。而笔者的一个合作研究基于中国某个城市的基层治理演变的案例研究(黄晓春、周黎安,2016)发现,2009年之后该城市的街道孵化了许多社会组织,许多政府事务外包给了这些社会组织。在“行政外包”之下,街道与社会组织之间的边界从外部特征(如资产所有权)看体现了国家与社会的清晰边界。而我们的进一步分析表明,街道对社会组织的“行政外包”具备“行政内包”的很多特征,大多数社会组织的领导来自“体制内”,甚至还在“体制内”存在晋升的可能性。这些社会组织看似在“官衙之外”,但其实是“体制之内”,街道政府与社会组织之间所谓的国家与社会的边界其实是“伪”边界。

政府公共部门应该采取什么样的治理结构?长期以来,大多数国家尤其是西方国家采取的是韦伯意义上的官僚制,即基于理性原则设计的层级式管理结构。它有以下几个基本特征:一是分工明确和设计合理的职位体系和等级结构,具有专业化职能的行政部门各司其职,在上级的指令和协调下运作。二是行政官员以官僚为职业,其选任基于专业技术资格,进入官僚部门必须通过专门的考试或凭借资质证明,官员是上级任命而非选举,官员的报酬是固定工资,升迁以业绩和资历为基准。行政官员的特点是专业化、职业化和非人格化,非人格化是指官员和上级的关系是非个人依赖的,下级只是服从组织,而非个人。三是整个官僚组织强调形式化和规则约束,行政程序依据法律规范而设立,必须严格执行。官僚制以理性、效率和程序公正为原则,它的出现和发展被认为是西方现代化过程中一个极为重要的组成部分。

大多数国家政府治理的方式如同韦伯式官僚制所设计的那样,政府对其公务人员采用的通常是一种弱激励:他们领取的通常是固定工资,即使有突出的表现,也往往只能获得精神鼓励而没有相应的物质奖励;他们的升迁往往是按照年限设定的,如无特殊情况,一般不会提前升迁。公务员讲究的是照章办事,如没有允许,即使是正确的事,也不能擅作主张。这些方面与企业对员工的激励形成了鲜明对比:在企业中,员工的薪酬往往是与其工作的业绩挂钩的,工作表现突出的员工更容易获得升迁的机会。

那么为什么政府内部会倾向于使用弱激励的方式?根据Tirole(1994),这是由政府治理区别于企业治理的一些技术特征决定的。政府在以下几个方面和私人企业存在着差异:第一,政府面临着多个维度的目标;相比之下,企业的经营目标非常明确,就是追求利润最大化。第二,政府提供的服务大都属于垄断供应,缺乏竞争,其工作绩效缺乏可以比较的基准,并且难以测度;第三,政府作为一个代理人,有着多个委托人,如消费者、企业、退休金领取者等等,并且这些委托人的偏好各不相同;企业虽然也有股东、债权人等不同的利益相关人,但它们的利益相对来说比较容易协调。第四,政府的所有权是相对分散的。而可能正是政府的这种多任务、多代理人的特点造成了弱激励在政府中存在的合理性。

关于政府部门非常强调服从程序和照章办事,Laffont和Tirole(1993)提供了一个有意思的解释。政府代表了多个利益集团的利益,并且比这些集团拥有信息上的优势。如果政府可以任意利用这些信息优势作出决策,那么势必会影响一些集团的利益,这样,所有的集团都会努力影响政府,让其只根据对自身有利的信息作出决策。这样,就容易形成利益集团和政府之间的勾结,滋生腐败。为了防止这样的情况产生,要求政府公务员严格照章办事,而不是根据自己的信息作出决策,就是一种较为合理的做法了。

Dixit(1996,1997)则从政府面临多维度目标和多个委托人的角度来解释了政府治理中的弱激励。他认为,政府是多个委托人(如消费者、企业、国会和其他利益集团)所共有的代理人,与此同时需要完成的任务也是多样的。如果对其中某项任务的绩效加以强激励,就会导致政府对这项任务投入太多的关注而忽略了其他任务。为了让政府平衡完成各项任务,给予所有任务弱激励就可能是合理的了。

如果政府的职员面临的是固定的薪酬制,工作流程又是照章办事。那么,他们工作的动力来源在哪里?我们又该如何理解这些政府官僚的激励和行为呢?

西方的经济学和政治学文献把政治领域的公职人员区分为政治家和政府官僚两类。政治家是由选民选出来的,必须对选民负责,因此他们面临的激励主要来自如何获得竞选的胜利,对于在位者则是如何获得连任,所以政治家的激励和行为必须从民主选举和政党竞争去理解。[^4]

政府官僚属于政治家的雇员,他们必须对政治家负责,虽然有时也接受议会的监督和质询,但总体上说相对独立于选民的直接压力。至于如何理解政府官僚的激励和行为,在西方经济学和政治学文献里,这方面有影响的理论并不多,最著名的是尼斯坎南的公共官僚模型(Niskanen, 1971)。尼斯坎南认为,公共部门的行政首脑的目标是部门预算最大化。部门规模越大,部门首脑的行政权力一般也越大。虽然行政预算最后需要由立法机关批准,但公共部门的官僚利用他们所掌握的私人信息,在预算过程中可以夸大其经费支出的规模。所以,根据这个模型,公共部门的预算规模总是过度膨胀的。尼斯坎南开出的药方是建立一个类似于市场的机制,使多个行政部门在一个服务领域内竞争,竞争不仅有助于降低成本,也可以改进服务质量,让表现不佳的部门最终淘汰出局。

关于尼斯坎南的官僚模型,有许多学者提出了批评,其中有两点批评值得提及。一种批评认为,尼斯坎南的官僚模型的基本假设是,官僚个人有让部门规模最大化的动力,可是,在一个制度化的官僚体系中,官僚相对固定的薪酬主要取决于正式的职位和工作年限,与部门规模无关,而真正得益的可能是该部门的底层和中间雇员,他们因为部门扩大、职位增加而增加了晋升机会,但作为该部门的行政首脑却获益很少。第二个批评是,公共官员的职位并不完全限于一个部门,他们会把自己的职业前景放在这个官僚体系中加以考虑(盖伊·彼得斯,2006年,第12—13页)。这两个批评的核心在于指出,尼斯坎南的官僚模型虽然在一定程度上缴释了公共部门内在膨胀的趋势,但并没有真正准确地抓住公共官僚行为激励的来源,没有在官员个人的利益(如薪酬和晋升)和部门预算之间建立起一个清晰可见的联系。

对于在薪酬相对固定的政府部门工作的公职人员来说,促使其努力工作的主要激励是对于职业前景的考虑。这要分为两种情况考虑。借用Mattozzi和Merlo(2007)的提法,我们将政府官员分为“职业官员”和“以官员为职者”[^5] ,前者是决定长期从事政府工作的,而后者只是将政府工作当成一个职业过渡。对于前者来说,为政府工作的激励,主要是可能的升迁、掌握更大的权力;而对于后者而言,为政府工作的激励,主要是通过在政府的工作提高自身的知名度、扩展自己的人脉,为将来谋求一份好工作做准备。虽然这两类人在动机上有所差异,但有一点是共通的,即他们看重的不光是在政府得到的工资,更重要的是一份对未来的期待。

本书研究的地方官员绝大多数应该属于“职业官员”。有意思的是,在大多数国家的政府治理深感困难的领域,即如何有效激励这些以政治为职业的政府官员服务于社会的目标,中国却开辟了一条独特的道路。我们后面将详细研究,中国对于数量众多的地方官员如何发展出一系列的激励模式,比如地方分权和财政包干制,还有一个非常重要的机制就是政治锦标赛,即让若干个同级地方官员相互竞争,最后将经济绩效最好的一位官员提拔到一个更高的职位。这个激励机制为中国持续的高速增长奠定了关键性的制度基础(周黎安,2004,2007;周黎安等,2005;Li and Zhou,2005)。

自从韦伯提出理性官僚制理论以来,对于理性官僚制的批评就一直没有停止过。批评最多的包括官僚制的低效率和形式主义,行政部门的垄断性和固定薪酬制使得行政官员缺乏激励为公众提供高质量的服务,而过分依赖规则和程序导致了政府部门臭名昭著的形式主义、办事拖拉和相互扯皮。从90年代开始,西方公共管理部门和理论界掀起了一场所谓的“新公共管理”运动,旨在为传统的官僚制注入类似于市场机制的因素,提高公共部门的效率和服务质量。新公共管理运动在新西兰、澳大利亚、美国等发达国家影响很大,成为改造政府治理结构、重新塑造政府形象的指导思想。相比传统的官僚制,新公共管理强调以顾客为导向,把政府服务的结果和绩效放在第一位,而不是以牺牲效率为代价恪守僵化的规则和程序,在政府部门引入契约制和绩效评估,强化政府雇员的激励;与此同时,重新调整政府职能的边界,把一些原来属于政府部门直接管理的公共服务开始外包给市场上的中介组织,引入市场竞争。所以新公共管理运动在两个方面做出了重要改革,一是改变政府雇员的激励方式,把传统的弱激励尽可能转换成强激励,加强绩效评估和可问责性;二是突破传统的政府治理的边界,选择更为灵活的发包形式替代低效率的政府直接供应。这使得新的政府治理更接近于市场上的企业治理方式。

我们在前面详细分析了政府治理中的一系列富有特色的因素,其中就涉及上级政府对下级政府的契约制,如订立责任状,还有更重要的,就是政府间行政事务的发包制。这种行政发包制属于政府组织内部的发包,既区别于传统的韦伯意义上的官僚制,又不同于西方新公共管理中的发包制——即政府向市场的外部发包。

## A.3 政府间关系：分权与财政联邦主义

如果像传统经济学假定的那样,中央政府能够完全根据居民的偏好、经济中的产品和服务总量以及资源禀赋提供公共产品,从而实现社会福利最大化,那么就不需要多级政府的存在,也不需要政府间的财政分权了。但是事实并非如此简单,财政分权在现实中确实存在,而且还在不断发展,这种现象吸引了一大批经济学家的关注,产生了所谓的“财政联邦主义理论”(fiscal federalism)。

财政联邦主义理论从福利经济学的视角出发,假设政府是一个追求公民整体福利最大化的组织,在此框架下讨论中央和地方政府财政职能的最优分配以及为实现这些职能分配服务的税收、支出安排以及转移支付等问题。

在财政职能分配方面,财政联邦主义理论认为,地方政府更接近自己的公众,更了解其所管辖区选民的效用与需求;同时与中央政府相比,地方政府也面临更少的政治约束(如地区平等的要求)。所以,如果公共产品可以同等地由地方政府和中央政府提供,那么由下级政府提供则效率会更高(Oates,1972,1999)。这是财政分权理论的一个基本结论。但是,由于地方政府对于宏观经济稳定这种全国性的公共产品既缺乏兴趣又缺乏充足的财力,而经济主体跨地区的流动性也严重束缚了地方政府进行收入再分配的尝试,因此宏观经济稳定与收入再分配职能应由中央政府负责(Musgrave,1959)。

在著名的蒂伯特模型(Tiebout, 1956)中,财政分权还有一个近乎完美的结果:设想每个辖区的居民都可以自由迁徙,即“用脚投票”。辖区的政府为了尽可能吸引更多的人来居住(这样可以获得更多的税源),就必须推出各具特色、有竞争力的财政政策,最后在均衡的情况下就会形成居民的偏好与辖区地方性公共产品的特性与结构之间的有效匹配。财政分权和辖区地方政府之间的竞争,加上居民的自由流动性,可以产生一个有效率的地方公共产品的供给。蒂伯特模型是一个简单而漂亮的关于财政分权的理论,但它在现实生活中的有效性受到很多人的质疑,如居民的自由迁徙,即使在美国也难以实现(如穷人就很少自由迁徙),何况在发展中国家。[^6] 不过,正如奥茨所指出的那样,即使没有居民的自由流动性,财政分权的益处仍然存在(Oates,1999)。

为了实现政府间的公共职能就需要有相应的财政工具。在政府间税收及支出分配方面,财政联邦主义理论认为,地方政府应注重对管辖区内流动性较低的经济单位和要素征税,而把对流动性较高的经济单位和要素的征税权力交给上级政府,否则具有较高流动性的经济单位为了少缴税而在各辖区间来回选择,对个人和社会都是损失。进一步说,地方政府应该征收财产税,州政府应该主要征收消费税,中央政府应该主要征收收入税。Oates和Schwab(1991)继续细化了以上原则,认为地方政府应该注重征收流动性经济单位的受益税(benefit tax),换句话说,这些经济单位受益于当地政府给予的公共产品和服务,因此就应该支付一部分税收补充这些服务。与此同时,从效率要求出发,地方政府要避免征收流动经济单位的非受益税(如为收入再分配的目的而征收的税),非受益税应由上一级政府征收。

在转移支付方面,财政联邦主义理论强调了不同层次政府之间转移支付的三种潜在作用:内部化财政溢出效应的收益、地区管辖区之间财政均等化和整体税收体系的改善。比如地方政府对居民教育的投资不仅对本地区有利,当居民迁出本地区之后,对别的地区也会产生溢出效应。如果不存在合适的补偿机制,地方政府对教育的投资激励会下降。由上级政府分配的转移支付可以理解为是对地方公共产品跨地区溢出效应的补偿。不同层次政府之间转移支付主要采取两种形式:第一种是附加条件的转移支付,通常采取配套资金(matching grants)的方式,即上级政府根据地方政府的投入量确定相应的配套资金。第二种是无条件的转移支付,即一般性的转移支付。一般而言,用于内部化溢出效应的收益的转移支付多采用配套性转移支付,而用于地区管辖区之间财政均等化的转移支付多采用无条件的转移支付。

上述财政联邦主义理论也被称为第一代财政联邦主义理论,原因在于,它是从福利经济学的视角进行分析,假设所有政府的目标都是社会福利最大化。但是,政府是由追求自身利益的政府官员组成的,而政府官员的利益并不一定和社会保持一致,所以政府并不会总表现出有利于社会福利的行为。以钱颖一、温格斯特(Weingast)、怀尔达辛(Wildasin)等为代表的经济学家提出了第二代财政联邦主义,在财政分权框架下引入了激励和契约理论,重新探讨第一代财政联邦主义的经典问题。

钱颖一、温格斯特(Qian and Weingast,1997)阐述了第二代财政联邦主义(有时也称之为保护市场的财政联邦主义)的主要观点。首先,他们质疑了以往政府是公民福利的最大化者的假设。他们认为,政府和政府官员都有自己的物质利益,和企业经理人相类似,政府官员只要缺乏约束就会有寻租行为,所以必须要有一个有效的政府治理结构来实现官员利益和地方居民福利之间的激励相容。他们认为,联邦制能够促使各地区之间的竞争,而地区之间的竞争结果会影响各地政府官员的自身利益(如在民主国家,这会影响到政府官员的当选),因此,它可以保证地方政府采取保护市场的行为。

其次,钱颖一和温格斯特从可置信承诺的视角讨论了中央和地方的分权问题。他们认为,在保护地方市场的问题上,政府应该用某种承诺来提供“正的”和“负的”激励,前者用来防止政府对企业和居民的掠夺性行为,后者用来惩罚预算软约束。一方面,如果采取联邦制的分权,中央政府事实上是限制了自己对事后的信息的使用权,以及它对经济主体的直接控制和掠夺,这将使地方政府可以从本地的经济繁荣中获益,从而有激励采取繁荣经济的措施。另一方面,联邦制的分权也有助于地方政府的预算约束的硬化。在这种分权制度下,银行控制着信贷,地方政府却无权干预,因此政府不能通过无限度地借钱来保护落后企业,从而带来预算约束的硬化。此外,地方政府间的竞争还对地方政府随意干预市场构成约束,区域政府间的竞争限制了官员的掠夺性行为,因为要素(特别是外资)是可以用流动的方式来躲避地方政府的过度管辖,要素的流动还增大了地方政府补助落后企业的成本(Qian and Roland,1998)。

最后,钱颖一等人还对财政联邦主义的可持续性问题做出了进一步的研究。他们指出,财政分权有助于政府可靠地维护市场,但要达到这种效果,联邦主义政策的实行必须是可持续的,这种可持续性的产生需要政府具有自我强制机制予以保证,政府官员必须有遵守联邦主义规则的激励。并指出,若要使财政联邦主义持续、稳定的发挥作用,必须具备两点:即必须给中央监督下级政府逃避责任的充分资源;同时地方政府必须具有通过一致反对中央政府滥用权力的监督手段。

最近十几年,随着许多发展中国家和转型经济国家先后采取了分权化的改革措施,关于地方分权和财政分权的研究在国内外学术界都是一个热点问题。中国的改革开放就始于行政性分权和财政包干制的推行。然而关于地方分权是否促进了中国地区经济的发展以及如何发挥作用,国内外的研究文献尚没有达成一致的看法。[^7] 一些经济学家的经验研究表明,地区分权和财政分权促进了经济增长和资源配置的效率(Lin and Liu,2000;Jin,Qian and Weingast,2005;史宇鹏、周黎安,2007),但另外一些研究发现财政分权不利于经济增长和收入分配(Park et al.,1996;Zhang and Zou,1998;Knight and Li,1999)。[^8]

最后,我们介绍一个非常主要的概念:“可置信的承诺”(credible commitment)。它是博弈论中的一个重要概念,是指符合序贯理性(sequential rationality)要求的承诺。政府间的关系,政企关系以及转型经济中出现的很多问题,都可以从承诺的可信性方面加以研究。

举例来讲,著名社会主义经济学家科尔奈曾经提出过著名的“预算软约束”问题,即国有企业因为预期到政府会在其经营困难的时候出面资助,而缺乏激励努力经营(Kornai,1980)。从承诺可信性的角度看,“预算软约束”问题事实上可以归结为委托人不能事前有效承诺不向代理人提供帮助,从而导致代理人激励不足的问题。再如,在转轨经济中有一种常见的“棘轮效应”(即“鞭打快牛”)现象,国家倾向于向效益更好的企业要求更多的利税。由于“棘轮效应”的存在,效益好的企业会尽力隐瞒自己的赢利,甚至故意压缩自己的产量,以换得一个轻松一点的计划指标或赢利指标。从承诺可信性的角度看,“棘轮效应”问题就是委托人不能事前有效承诺,不论代理人前期的绩效如何,后期的计划指标都是固定的,不会相机加码。从以上两个问题,我们不难看出,如果存在着事前的承诺不可信的问题,就有可能导致参与人激励的扭曲,进而造成效率的损失。因此,委托人如何做出可置信的承诺就变得十分重要了。

根据Shepsle(1991),可信承诺可以分为两类,即“动机意义上的可信承诺”和“强制意义上的可信承诺”,前者指的是符合参与人激励相容约束,可以被自我实施的承诺;而后者指的通过外在约束或压力保证的承诺。

“动机意义上的可信承诺”大体上相当于博弈论里的“声誉机制”,即在一个无限期的重复博弈中,当事人考虑到自己的声誉对未来收益的影响,会自觉地信守自己事前的承诺。“强制意义上的可信承诺”则主要通过以下方式来保证:

第一种方式是信息的分散化。一般来说,当事人之所以不信守承诺是发现了可资利用的信息,比如“棘轮效应”中委托人观察到代理人前期的产量,因而据此推断代理人的内在能力。而如果委托获得信息的渠道被屏蔽,双方在事前事后的信息结构是一样的,这样当事人就不会有激励去改变承诺。Qian和Weingast(1997)用这种观点讨论了中国改革过程中出现的“经济联邦制”。中央政府通过下放权力给地方政府明确地限制了自己的权力范围和信息通道,这使得中央政府的承诺更为可信。以改革初期各地出现的乡镇企业为例,中央政府只是在事前制定了相应的制度。由于中央政府关于企业生产能力的信息十分有限,而获取这些信息的成本也十分高昂,因此政府不可能根据乡镇企业的生产状况去改变已经制定的政策。这种“联邦制”所带来的权力和信息的分散化就在事实上使得中央政府的承诺变得可信起来。

第二种方式是引入竞争。一般来说,如果契约的一方是垄断者,那么他很有可能违背承诺,这是因为契约的另一方根本没有其他选择。而如果引入竞争,使得原来别无选择的一方有“用脚投票”的权利,那么,一方在事前的承诺就会可靠得多。例如,Ronald和Sekkat(2000)在分析棘轮效应的时候发现,在社会主义制度环境下,“棘轮效应”广泛存在,而当经济转型开始后,这种现象就明显减少了。他们认为,这是由于经济转型带来的私有部门的竞争。在有了私有部门的竞争后,市场对经理人员的竞争会使政府部门自愿地对自己的激励方案做出可信的承诺。于是承诺问题就通过来自私有部门的竞争、引入经理人市场而解决了。再如,Segal(1998)在研究预算软约束问题时发现,垄断企业获得政府扶植的可能性很大,而如果存在大量的竞争性企业,那么每个企业享受补贴的概率就会大为下降。这使得企业不再花费很大的努力寻求政府的帮助,而政府不补贴企业的承诺也就变得可信起来了。因此,竞争的引入也可以帮助解决预算软约束问题。

第三种是权力的分散化。如果契约的双方中有一方拥有另一方难以有效制衡的权力,那么它就有可能为改进自身利益而利用这种权力任意改变契约的内容,从而使得其事前的承诺变得不可置信;相反,当这种权力变得分散、容易被制约时,其承诺的可信程度就会上升。一个经典的例证来自North和Weingast(1989)的研究。在这项研究中,他们考察了1688年“光荣革命”前后国王借债能力的变化。他们发现,随着“光荣革命”确立了君主立宪制,大大削弱了王权,国王的借债能力反而大大增加了。诺思和温格斯特认为,这是由于当国王的权力过大时,他可以任意撕毁还债承诺;而当王权受限后,赖账不还的可能性变小了,因此有更多的商人愿意把钱借给国王,这导致国王借债能力的提高。

第四种是资源的分散化。当委托人掌握的资源远远不足以救助处于困境中的代理人时,他关于不救助的事前承诺就可以置信了。Dewatripoint和Maskin(1995)利用这种思路讨论了“预算软约束”现象。他们发现,当给予企业贷款后,小银行对企业提供救助的概率要远远小于大银行。这是因为,小银行资源有限,即使想为企业提供救助也是有心无力,因此其预算约束就要比大银行紧得多。而在转型国家银行业高度集中,国家事前警告国有企业说,你们必须自负盈亏,资不抵债就让你们破产,对于这种承诺国有企业很难信以为真。这意味着随着中国地方政府对于银行系统的贷款决策影响变小,地方政府关于国有企业自负盈亏的承诺就比中央政府的类似承诺要更可信。所以,在中国,从中央一直到乡镇政府,政府层级越低,融资能力越弱,所属企业所面临的预算约束就越硬,这可以解释为什么在八九十年代,乡镇企业的经营效率要普遍高于国有企业。
